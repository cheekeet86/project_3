Searched this sub and Google for images of the races sheets and command mats look like after lamination, but couldn't find anything. So I thought i would take a few moments to post my images.

Just got them done today. The laminate is 10m matte. Got them done at Staples. Cost was 82$CAD. Definately worth it. The race sheets fit in legal size laminate pouches, and 2 command mats fit into 1 ledger size pouch.

I rounded the corners before and after lamination, and wiped them down before lamination as well.

I should mention, my camera glass is broken. Any foggyness is not because of the lamination, it's my camera. The race sheets are crystal clear.",0.033,0.819,0.148,0.9052,10.862400000000001

It's a great thematic dice-chucking game with lots of tense moments and laughs throughout.

Anyway, I've got a couple of questions:

1) In the context of a new game / fresh board, it seems that oceans are a bad idea in terms of 'competitiveness'. It does not reward/incentivize anything. What I mean is: you spend resources placing an ocean down, and you don't even get the bonus. ANYONE ELSE can get the bonus. So you, as the person placing it, spend resources to put in a tile in which you only benefit from +1 to TR and placement bonuses, whereas someone else could just wait it out, place a greenery tile, own the area (which counts towards the landlord award and gardener milestone), get +1 to TR as well, AND also +1 VP from the greenery itself. (Not to mention +1 if he owns a city beside it). Thus I am having a hard time comprehending why would anybody want to ever place an ocean first. The opportunity cost is so much greater than if you were to just spend the same amount of resources building a greenery.

2) Some cards say ""require 7% oxygen"", I'm assuming this is require 7% oxygen OR GREATER, correct? Because it wouldn't be logical if it was literally playable on exactly 7% oxygen levels. (Asking this because some of the cards are worded with ""X% or less"" or ""X% or more"" whereas some cards dont have these texts)

3) Some cards say, for example, add 2 microbes / animals to ANOTHER card. Does this mean that you must have another card that ""collects"" these resources? E.g. decomposers card collects microbes, so you can only add the microbes to this card, correct? I'm guessing if you don't have decomposers, or any other micro-resource collection card, then basically you can't add these micro-resources.

4) Because there are so many things to track / move everytime you do something, e.g. paying 8 plants to add a greenery tile, you have to physically move the cubes back to the cube pile, then add your tile, put the player marker, add the TR, raise the oxygen, and even many other power cards that may or may not activate. Thus, if a player forgets the passive of these cards, what's the best play here? Allow the player to retroactively get the resources or just too bad for him cuz he wasted his resources?

5) In terms of the ""sabotage"" cards, e.g. meteors or asteroids which will remove plant resources from a player, what is the incentive of NOT doing so? It seems logical to ALWAYS do it (it is a competitive game after all) but the rules mention something about it being 'optional' and that 'it is not very nice' to do so.

42,t3_ccteu2,Bestie and I had an epic 80-hour gaming heptathalon on a 10-day gaming retreat!,62,"So I have a vacation home in the Pacific northwest. I invited several friends to go relax, retreat, and game, but most of the time it was my best buddy and me. We created a gaming Olympiad, a heptathalon (if that's a word), and I'm going to tell you all about it! If you wanna read only about certain events, you can skip forward to:

1: pixel tactics

2: mtg power cubes

3: deck builders

4: EPIC

5: battlecon

6: Carl Chudyk

7: Food Chain Magnate 

&amp;&amp;&amp;

The Olympiad consisted of 7 events, or pillars. First to win 4 takes it down. We jumped around from pillar to pillar each day to prevent burn out on one game.

&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;

Pillar 1: pixel tactics constructed. Create 3 decks from all the sets. Play each deck versus each opposing deck twice each (18 games) plus one game with the deck of your choice. Best 10/19 games takes the pillar. This pillar took an incredible amount of prep. We had to sort through about 15 cards and pick 3 leaders to build around. That took days of analysis paralysis. Ultimately, the leaders I picked hard countered a couple of his. Like, he had Byron (all your dudes have two life but only ever take one damage) and I had Lixis (1 damage to all opposing dudes every wave). He had Adjenna (opponents can't use clear corpse action) and I had Luca (you can redraw top card of discard pile if you use it right away, ie spam revive corpse orders). After about 8 matches and having seen each of our leaders, he scooped the pillar to me to save time. And no, there was no coming back, his scoop was not premature.

&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;

Pillar 2: MtG Power Cubes. I have two vintage powered cubes. One that is more combo oriented and balanced, and one that has almost no combo and is more interactive. So we started with the combo cube. We pack drafted two decks simultaneously, having to allocate each drafted card to deck A or B. Then each deck played each opposing deck in a best 3/5 match. That's 4 matches so far. Then we used the other cube and simultaneously drafted 3 decks and played each against each other in a 3/5 (9 more matches). Best 7/13 matches takes the pillar. 

So in the first cube, I dominated. Drafted a show n tell style deck and a mono green crater hoof natural order deck. He drafted a reanimator deck and a mono white control/Armageddon/winter orb/stax deck. Both mine beat both of his and I took a 4-0 match advantage. Then on the other cube, I drafted mono red aggro, mono white midrange, and UB control. He drafted esper control, jund midrange, and WG aggro. He stormed back! My red deck lost two matches them barely beat wg on a mana screw. Then my W deck went 0-3. So now the match score is 5-5!!! First to 7 takes the pillar. Then my UB beats jund, barely, with game 5 ending in such a grind that he decks out. 6-5. Then my UB beats wg and takes down the pillar! Extremely nerve wracking. I thought he was gonna crack my 4-0 lead!!!

&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;

Pillar 3: deck building. So we were really limited on games due to suitcase space. So in this pillar, we would play Star Realms, Tanto Cuore, and Flip City, each best 3/5. Whoever wins two of those three takes the pillar. We start with star realms. I win two in a row then he wins 3. Then we play flip city and he sweeps me. Takes down the pillar in under 2 hours!!

&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;

Pillar 4: EPIC. So for those not familiar, this game is kinda mtg: lite. So we each have 3 sets of cards. We started by open drafting a deck and playing 3/5, which I took down. Then we constructed 2 decks each and played 4 matches best 3/5 each. We split those. I took down the pillar best 3 of 5 matches (each 3/5 games). Interestingly, one pair of decks we each built was quite similar, a red yellow control deck with lots of removal and recursion.

&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;

Pillar 5: battlecon. So we each drafted 20 fighters and split them into 5 teams of 4. We use each team once, best 3/5 matches (one team versus another team for a match). The format was this: simultaneously ban an opposing fighter. Then play best of 3. Game 1 you simultaneously pick an opposing fighter they can't use in game 1. Game two features an arena effect. Best 2/3 takes the match. 

Match 1: the game 2 arena says that each beat, you gain a life if you didn't hit the opposing fighter. I ban Madelina (scary) and he bans Seth. Game 1: my Prince Elien loses to Clinhyde as I'm unable to ever benefit from my wall protection. Game 2 is my Tatsumi versus his Runika. We dance around forever. I'm trying to gradually pick off his artifacts before engaging. Late, I end up making a blunder on a beat where he couldn't even reach me by waking forward directly into his fist and giving the game away. He's up 1 match to none.

Match 2. The game 2 arena gradually fills the board up with candles on your space, end of beat, or damages you if you're on one. When board is full of candles, you can then ante candles you're on to gain various effects, including ignore stun guard. He bans aria, I ban shekhtur. 

Game 1: my burgundy loses to his lymn. Lymn constantly causes prio mix ups and I was repeatedly wrong. Game 2 my Karin plays way too predictably and loses to his main, zaamassal. He takes match 2 and now I'm totally in my own head, feeling like he can read me at every decision.

Match 3: the game 2 arena says you can fall off the edge of the board and take 4 damage. I ban Wardlaw, his 3-4th main. He bans khadath. By the way, each of these battlecon matches was a different day, allowing the loser top rest and recoup. I reached the conclusion that I had been playing on yomi level zero (ie just playing what I thought were good attack pairs) and he was anticipating those. I went back to my old method of analyzing what his most likely pairs were. Game 1 my lucida crushes his merjoram. Both characters want to stand still and trade. Mine just does it better. He also didn't have his full concentration that day, hard reading me on several beats and just being bad at math and punting. Game 2 my Jin beats his Sarafina. Sara is one of my mains, which he hate drafted not really knowing how to use her. I hard read him a couple times, and my movement and hit confirm nullified his mix ups. I win the set 2-0 and trail 1 match to 2.

Match 4: the game 2 arena says each beat has a 50% chance of recycling backwards. I ban Hepzibah (our consensus #1 pick agreed) he bans Kajia. Game 1 my rukyuk beats his iaxus. Neither of us plays these characters much, but I get there. Game 2 i got what I thought was a good match up, my malandrax versus his kehrolyn, but I actually had trouble keeping her off me and he got there. 1-1. Game 3 my clive versus his cadenza. He remarks that this is a great matchup for him since he can stun me off my modules. I stay silent. Basically I take one big hit and then keep him at bay the rest of the game. He even lands a grapnel but I foresee this and use the thing that negates his on hit effects, so he can't pull me. I take it down easily. 2-2 in matches. Fortunately I have my strongest team last. 

Match 5: game 2 arena says the lower health player can move a barrier marker and nobody can end their movement on it. I ban Adjenna, his second main, he bans Thessala, my #1 pick. 
Game 1 my Cherri squeaks out a win against cesar. Game 2 in the arena is my lesandra versus his lixis. I request we play game 3 first since i have a great matchup, which we do. My baenvier crushes his orianna. I wait till he commits a lot of magic points to an attack them simply negate our styles, rendering his character practically useless. I win the final match and thus the pillar (making a huge comeback) and thus the entire Olympiad.

&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;

Pillar 6: chudyk. Best 4/7 mottainai, best 2/3 impulse, best 2/3 GTR. Whoever wins two of those takes it. He wins mottainai 4-3 but we don't end up completing the pillar because I won battlecon that afternoon and ended it. 

&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;

Pillar 7: beat 2/3 food chain magnate. Didn't start this one.

Well hope you enjoyed reading this. We had a great time playing the most epic gaming marathon ever. Took 80 hours to finish.",0.076,0.749,0.174,0.9995,61.969

52,t3_cd9zij,"City of Kings is very fun, until it suddenly isn't.",90,"My wife and I picked up the game from a local store. It was beautiful, we love co-op, we love videogames, we love RPG mechanics, what was there not to be stoked about?! We watched the tutorial video, set up the most basic scenario, started leveling up. It was super fun!

... Until it wasn't anymore. Suddenly we found a monster that did 3 reflect damage as our second fight, thank the game gods we could camp him to death from inside the city. But after that things became more manageable, it was lovely exploring and getting gear, we had a lot of fun!

... Until we weren't. Because the objective was to get a ton of ore, and we would have needed to go buckwild leveling up our caravans to even get close to winning. We were doomed from turn 4 or so.

So we set up a story. Tried to plan out a bit better. I went hard healer, she went damage and worker wild. It was a ton of fun, tromping over the map, working together to finish quests!

... Until it wasn't. A monster popped up with 3 range and WAY more than enough damage to wipe us both out in a single attack. I'd been upping my HP and healing alternately, and I STILL was 1-shot-kill-able. I literally would have had to put every point into health from square one to tank even a single attack, and then I'd have been useless for everything else but that. And that's not including abilities.

We waited for game night. 4 people SURELY would be more balanced, right? My wife went full tank, I went full healer, one of our friends went damage and the other was god of workers.

... Following the rules of setup, the FIRST monster did 5 reflect damage, and did more than enough damage per attack to kill 1 if not 2 people. So that was a hard reset.

We cheated. Took the points for leveling up to the starting xp levels as well as the starting boosts. Started the enemies at level 1 instead of 5. And you know what? The game was really, super fun! We played around, joked, everyone got to do what they loved doing most, it was a fantastic time!

... Until it wasn't. The boss spawned. We had been leveling up a lot, had really solid gear. We were pretty speciallized, so we didn't run into the same problems as before where nobody had enough damage to justify hitting a reflect, or enough up to take even a single hit. But the boss spawned with an ability called 'Whirlwind' (random chance to get that...) Which deals half his attack to all nearby allies of the main target.

Now, the TANK had 20 hp, and the boss had 16 FRELLING ATTACK. So the tank barely survived. Whirlwind, however, team wiped the rest of us, none of us having specced into health enough to suddenly eat 8 damage, not when you factored in all the poison and fire he was making appear everywhere as well, when the game had taught us the gospel of ""specialize, specialize, specialize!"" So we IMMEDEATELY, without any chance to react or have any warning, the first turn the boss appeared, in spite of the fact we cheated to be massively overleveled for where the game SAID we should be, lost in a single attack when he killed all 3 of us.

That wasn't fun. And it didn't feel like we'd planned poorly, or like we had been out strategied or like there was a single damn thing we could do about it. We died, it felt like, because ""F*ck you"", and there was no reason any other outcome should have been expected.

In my experiance, City of Kings is beautiful, clever, wild, fantastic, and a pure joy to play, especilly with friends when you each get to play the way you all want to play. The problem is when the game abruptly, and without warning, decides that the fun is over, and if you aren't positioned like x or specd out like y or have at least a in b stat, you lose now. Thanks for playing, jerkwad.

Our worker player felt AWFUL because once the boss spawned, she couldn't do much, and ended up being one of the ones who died. The game directly punished her for doing what it claimed she should have been more than free to do, to play her hero the way she deemed most enjoyable.

I don't know when we'll be playing again. If we even will. But I know I'll WANT to. I'll remember the good times. Roaming the board with friends, leveling up, beating monsters and completing quests. But I'll always remember ""this guy does 16 damage to the tank, and 8 damage to everyone else. Then he spawns fire and poison everywhere."" ""So... We lose then?"" ""...Yea. I guess. Huh. That sucks.""

The game is incredibly fun. Until it isn't. And I hate that I have to say that.

EDIT: It has come to my attention that the boss was played incorrectly. No matter what, says a small paragraph hidden on page 26 of the rulebook, upon spawning a boss does not immedeately activate. It is an easy mistake to make, as the turn order guide on your sheet, which the rules point out earlier ""if you have any questions about when what happens, the guide will set you straight."" seem to imply the boss activates first, unless you know of this exception beforehand.

Please note that, even with this new info, my opinion stands. The boss spawned, and evwn if we scattered and planned, he did 16 damage per swing, not taking into account completely filling the map with fire and poison, and teleporting directly to people. And my complaint is so much deeper than ""Boss beat me, game bad."" It wasn't just the boss. Even the two player game my wife and I won felt more like we succeeded by playing the game the least fun possible way. Because that was what the game demanded, what it wanted. It is a bunch of really fun and exciting concepts, wrapped in a thorny box of ""use none of this. Max damage and hp.""",0.168,0.667,0.165,-0.7584,-68.256

57,t3_cd4prk,[Dinosaur Island] Cheap custom rubber dinosaur meeples. Plus bonus scientists!,232,"https://m.imgur.com/a/um1DDQf

Got the standard version of Dinosaur Island on a whim the other day and was disappointed with the uniform and boring plastic dinosaur meeples, as well as the flimsy cardboard hexagons for the scientists.

I considered getting those upgrade packs for lots of monies or get something off etsy. Took a gamble and got tiny “rubber eraser” dinosaurs from amazon. They cost like ten bucks for 150(!) of them, in different models and colors. Turns out they fit the game’s paddocks perfectly and, being rubber, feel perfect as well. I was worried they’d just fall apart, but they’re quite sturdy!

Now I assume that since those are rubber erasers, they will disintegrate over time. We’ll see. But for now I recommend this as a great and dirt cheap way to upgrade your Dinosaur Island.

I am pleased to announce the launch of **Ticket To Ride Score Calculator app for Android**!

The app allows you to scan your Ticket To Ride game board using your **phone's camera** to calculate the game scores automatically!

Ticket To Ride is a great board game, but counting the final score at the end can be so annoying sometimes.There's the score marker, but more often than not, someone will forget to move it during the game and you end up counting the scores manually.

With this app you can simply take a picture of the game board using your phone's camera and it will automatically recognize player trains and calculate the scores for you!

Here’s the app in Android Play Store: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buslovsky....](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buslovsky.ttrsc) .

80,t3_cdk284,Games with distinct acts,50,"Hi all, I just played the new Jaws board game over the weekend, and afterwards our group talked about games with distinct acts. 

Jaws is a one vs all game with two acts. The first act involves hidden movement/deduction around an island map and the second is an extended battle sequence on a sinking boat. The acts share some physical components, but also have game pieces specific to each act. When the first act concludes, all the boards flip over, components are exchanged, and new game mechanics kick in. 

The only games I have personally played with two separate halves are Biblios, Betrayal at House on the Hill, and Galaxy Trucker:

-	In Biblios, the two halves (gift phase and auction phase) use the same deck of cards, but their mechanics for adding cards to your hand are drastically different. Act one uses card allocation (drafting) and act two obviously uses an auction.

-	In Betrayal, the beginning of the haunt triggers a shift from coop to one vs all gameplay (usually), as well as a whole additional set of rules and components.

-	Galaxy Trucker begins with a real-time tile placement phase and ends with an event resolution/scoring phase.

What are some other examples of this type of game structure? I am not so much talking about games with multi-step phases (i.e., Dinosaur Island). I also wouldn’t necessarily include the final battles against the baddies in Elder Sign or Camp Grizzly, as these moments are relatively short compared the bulk of the game.

Multiples acts are an interesting way of forcing a narrative shift in gameplay, as opposed to shifts that occur naturally (e.g., switching gears in Dominion to begin grabbing victory cards).

I am also interested in how multi-act games might relate/intertwine act one with act two. In both Jaws and Biblios, your performance in act one has direct implications for act two. Jaws allows you to play either act standalone, whereas my other examples must be played with both.

Anyway, let me know your thoughts! I think this would be a cool top ten list.",0.052,0.86,0.087,0.8733,43.665

86,t3_cdkyyo,[COMC] 2ish Years in.,25,"Hey everyone!

I got into the hobby for real about 2 years ago. I think it was general AMA subreddit in which the creator of **Salem 1692** was answering questions leading up to his kickstarter release. Something about that thread drew me in and I was hooked. I always have had a bunch of board games, but more the Monopoly types. One of my best friends was pretty into the modern scene and saw my interest and ran with it.

Here is a link to my “main collection.” [These are mostly the bigger box games](https://imgur.com/DvMNHI5)

These are the games that I personally like the most and try to get out to the table more often. They aren’t organized in any super specific kind of way, more on what fits in the shelves. But the the top two rows lean towards my favorites.

You may notice a bunch of dinosaur themed games in there. I’m a Dinosaur dork. That said, I haven’t actually gotten a chance to play **Raptor** or **Escape from 100 Million BC** yet. And the **Jurassic Park DANGER** game was a bit underwhelming the only play I have gotten in with it yet. 

Not playing games enough/at all is another trend with my collection. One that I hope to fix, but a problem nonetheless. I’ve honestly decided that I need to slow down on buying games to get my monies worth of the ones I have. I’ll make exceptions if the perfect deal comes by, but gone are the days when I passively pick up a game because I’ve found it super cheap. Other games of note that haven’t been played yet are **Galactic Scoundrels, Deadwood 1876, Scythe Wind Gambit Expansion**, and **QueenDomino. KingDominno** has been played many times though, one of our favorite quick pick up games. I picked up Queen if we have a larger group but it just hasn’t hit the table. We’ve played Sycthe a bunch of times too, but haven’t tried the expansions yet.

My favorite games in my collection are pretty much that top row. All of those games have seen their fair share of love and mostly have multiple plays in them, or are new enough to the group that we’ve only had the chance to play them once. **Scythe** and **Terraforming Mars** especially have gotten a lot of plays in. Our group doesn’t meet on a regular basis, pretty much only when a large enough group is all free together. There is also another member in the group that owns a larger collection that I do, of entirely different games, that we kind of bounce back and forth with. So even among our sessions, my games probably only hit the table half the time.

Probably the weirdest/coolest game I have is that **Titanic** game that my dad and uncles had in the 60s. The ship literally sinks as you play and you have to make it off the boat. It is a cool mechanic. 

[We also have a bunch of smaller box games](https://imgur.com/jWE9ioD)
These are kind of all over the place. Some are general party games, some are drinking games, and some are strategic. I don’t really have a good picture of them as they are spread all over the place, but the highlights in there are **Coup** (Probably our most played game), **Bang! The Dice Game** and **Forbidden Island**, which is a great game to teach new mechanics to newbies. I treat it as Pandemic Lite.

Yesterday I had noticed that my cards do not fit into the template of the manufacturer. After some back and forth I found out that the information in the offer was wrong. Therefore, the manufacturer had thought that there was a problem between me and my graphic designer that I should be made aware of.

But now everything is clarified and my template is correct for #Werewolf\_vs\_Vampire.

Today I attach another picture, with which shows the three terms from yesterday.

Otherwise I gave the playing cards today to a supporter of the first hour for proofreading. I'd rather have that proof-read again before it goes out to print.

  

## Day 10

Today I got the language corrections for the playing cards.

Great - I got another look from the outside and changed some things.So today my job was to go through all the cards again and adjust them.

Now certain keywords are always printed bold and requirements are listed individually. That makes the cards even clearer.

For tomorrow I have the task to start with the box design. This will certainly be much more extensive than the playing card design.

I look forward to it.

  

## Day 11

The day began with the spelling corrections of the corrections and the hint from a befriended game developer that I might have to pay attention to the total color application.

This was completely new territory for me, as I mostly created graphics for digital purposes.

Really interesting, because I learned something new again. Paper only takes up a certain amount of color and since it is printed in 4 layers, it can become too much.

(I only have a German link, but the graphics might explain most of it: [https://www.diedruckerei.de/c/druckdaten/farbauftrag](https://www.diedruckerei.de/c/druckdaten/farbauftrag))

After that I started with the box design. Unfortunately, I got a template for 540x80x80mm. But I need 480x80x104mm.

So, I made the attached graphic to make it clearer.

The colors are of course still adapted.

At the bottom the #Werewolf\_vs\_Vampire game mat is rolled up and at the top the game material.

91,t3_cdihoh,Social : Experiences sharing your boardgaming hobby/obsession with new people?,17,"Due to a variety of circumstances I am personally in a position where I am meeting a lot of new people, establishing new friends and acquaintances and in general finding myself speaking about my hobbies and how I spend my free time more and more. (It should be noted that most of these people are far detached from modern boardgaming).  


And while none of these experiences have been especially negative for me, I have had interactions in which people are noticeably taken aback by how involved it can be. I have a strategy established when I inevitably get the question ""what do you do two nights a week when you go out?"" and ""what is that shelf of stuff over there?"" which involves gathering intel on their own experiences with boardgames and going from there, be it involving them in a gateway game or a public game night. Discovering what level of ""gaming"" they are comfortable with early on seems to be key. 

&amp;#x200B;

However I've spoken to others that are close friends of mine and it seems interactions when introducing / discussing boardgames with someone not involved with the hobby vary wildly and I'd love to hear any stories or processes that you may follow. A couple of friends are even afraid to mention it, while others have had nothing but wild success indoctrinating their friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

So let's discuss!  


* How do you begin talking about the hobby? Do you feel in general it can be overwhelming?
* What are some of your experiences (negative or positive, why?) with introducing friends/family?
* Do you find it harder to be close friends with those that don't share your hobby?
* Have you personally seen or experienced people afraid of sharing this interest with others?
* Do you feel boardgaming specifically comes with it's own unique set of challenges in comparison to other more common hobbies? (Time, cost, 'nerd' stigma.)",0.036,0.851,0.112,0.9783,16.6311

1. Shuffle the boxes and take 6 random boxes to form the AI final result. 
2. place the 1st player to finish reward to the AI.
3. place wilds on each of the 7 other scoring cards.
4. You start with 0 wilds. Every time you need a wild, 
   1. take one from the scoring card and 
   2. place the scoring card to the AIs side. You can't score that type any more.
5. You score as normal, add the unused wilds to your score.
6. AI score = 
   1. interpreting the whole of the box contents as wilds. The sum of the AI is therefore 2+4x6 + center values =26 + center values.
   2. add to it the scoring cards.

A good player scores around 50 points, and this way the AI also scores around that. For replayability - the AI creates a new 2x3 box every time.

107,t3_cdmywl,DYI Gaming Table for less than $50,729,"Since starting in the boardgame hobby I’ve wanted a proper gaming table. However, formal gaming tables can range between hundreds and thousands of dollars. So after coming across this [video](https://youtu.be/devjNU0Yacg) and this [post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/BoardGameSpotlight/permalink/2726342887394817?sfns=mo), I set out to convert my dining table to a gaming table while sticking to a limited budget. I ended up spending about $45.

Disclaimer: I am not a professional carpenter or anything close to what you would call “handyman” so consider this when deciding if you are up to the challenge. 

Materials used:
1/2 x 4x 4 MDF Board $12.99
Can of adhesive spray $7.99
1 yard of black headliner material $10.99 
1 yard of grey felt wool material  $8.99
2” screws $Free (reused from table) 
1 pack of Anti-skid pads $2.99 

Tools used:
Drill
Stapler
Screwdriver


Time spent: 3 hours between cutting, stapling, and screwing the board to the table frame. 

Process:

I started by buying a panel of MDF at my local Home Depot and had them cut it down to size. I also purchased a can of adhesive spray and some anti-skid pads. Then I visited my local Jo-Ann fabrics for the headliner and wool felt material. 

I sprayed the MDF board with the adhesive spray and attached the headliner material to one side, I then added the wool material on top of the headliner material and used the stapler to attach it to the MDF board. Once that was completed, I used a drill to attach the MDF board to the frame of the table and once that was completed then I put on the legs, tested the sturdiness of the board (it was firm and didn’t need any more screws), and attached the anti-skid pads so that when I placed the top back on it wouldn’t move around. 

Side note: this was a challenging build for me, but one that I am sure others can do as well. I hope you all play more games.

Edit 1: Wow. I was not expecting this post to be so well received and I wanted to thank everyone for the encouraging messages/comments. Also, I wanted to clarify since it was asked that the dining table set only cost $30 because it was bought at a yard sale and I felt comfortable being able to get another one if I made some irreparable mistake. So all in, I spent $30 for the table and chairs and $45 in materials.

Maybe make the minis an add on box for people without access to a printer?

It would also be nice just to have them as a collection of quality models. You could reprint a damaged or lost piece. You could print an army if you wanted to use them for a wargame or something. A lot of the games get fan made models anyways, but it'd be a nice touch to have official ones. I'd be a good way to get around games avoiding scenarios because of component limitations.

125,t3_cebtik,[COMC] 10+ years of boardgaming. I have a problem. Please help.,14,"Here she is: [https://imgur.com/a/oDQBo2h](https://imgur.com/a/oDQBo2h)

&amp;#x200B;

I recently cleaned out and sold a big chunk of my collection so it would fit better in its already sprawling environs. I got rid of most of the euros that I'd played out, a few wargames that were too big to ever get played (Guderian's Blitzkrieg kinda games), and then more...stuff I didn't need.

&amp;#x200B;

I think if I could make one change I'd probably own fewer squad level tactical systems and fewer CCG/LCGs. Un-pictured are complete Netrunner, Doomtown: Reloaded, Ashes, AGoT 2nd Ed., L5R and an enormous MTG collection. Both types of game are just deadly to me. I can't resist.

&amp;#x200B;

CCG/LCGs let you build unique things, or pick the things that suit you best, they create the best game state puzzles, and they're competitive in a way that's exciting and snappy. Squad level tactical games also do some of those things but then also happen to tell the best stories. So maybe I shouldn't own fewer because they're the perfect games for me? I don't know. This must be what the spiral of addiction looks like from inside.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the overall message of my collection is captured by The Office episode where Oscar is helping Michael with his finances and points at a bar chart representing his spending and says ""this scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs like multiple magic sets"".

Then we began to have fun picking a song that would be the “theme song” for a game. I’m not talking like thematic music you play to set the mood while playing the game. These were songs whose lyrics or something felt like a good intro / way to get pumped about the game and matched it really well.

Well now I have this idea of creating a playlist where all the songs are different board game “theme songs”. Perhaps I can hit shuffle and that could help us pick a game when we can’t decide. So I wanted to share this idea with the community and ask for recommendations for thematic board game theme songs. And feel free to share you match even if you see a game already has a different recommendation, maybe one song will fit better depending on the group.

**Res Arcana Final Thoughts:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Lh_OhsNKp4

An interesting back and forth between designer and reviewer that gets a bit dramatic and even somewhat harsh at points. I'm a bit surprised since Rahdo really praised the game and already declared it one of the best games of 2019. The argument stems from the fact that Rahdo is, as we all know, the ultimate carebear, and Tom is of the opinion that Rahdo put way too much negative emphasis on the relatively minor take that/attack aspects of the game, which Rahdo wasn't a big fan of.

To add to the strategy aspect, they could also collect points and multipliers for specific goals - interesting location, furthest location from starting point, etc... Like a reverse scavenger hunt? Amazing race?

The points will then be used in an auction for prizes for the winners.

The idea is there will be multiple ways to win and to force teams to come up with the most successful strategy. I could use some help balancing the game and making sure it's fair.

157,t3_ceftjg,Battles of Westeros: Fantasy Flight's other Game of Thrones board game,12,"Way back in 2003, Fantasy Flight Games released the *A Game of Thrones* board game, which essentially fused elements of the classic board game *Diplomacy* into the **A Song of Ice and Fire** setting. A huge success, the game has remained continuously in print up until today, getting a second edition and multiple expansions, the latest of which was released only last year, along the way. 

Back in 2010 Fantasy Flight released their second ASoIaF-based board game, *Battles of Westeros*, a miniatures wargame which, as the box proclaims, spins off of the popular *BattleLore* rules system. The game received several expansions, but the line was abruptly cancelled in 2012. Despite that, the base game remains available at reasonable prices thanks to eBay, although the expansions are a lot more hit and miss.

Having recently gotten a copy of the game and several expansions (*Lords of the River*, *Tribes of the Vale* and the big *House Baratheon* expansion), I was surprised to see that the game had done poorly, as it is excellent. 

On a basic level, *Battles of Westeros* is a spin-off of the popular **Command &amp; Colors** line of wargame/board game hybrids created by designer Richard Borg in 2000. This system has spawned a whole range of different iterations, the best-known and biggest-selling of which is the WWII version, *Memoir ’44*. The most recent is the excellent space opera version, *Red Alert: Space Fleet Warfare*, with other versions ranging from *Command &amp; Colors: Napoleonics* to *Tricorne* (based on the American Revolutionary War) to *The Great War*, based on WWI. Most relevant here is *BattleLore*, a fantasy version featuring knights, griffins, trolls and elves. *Battles of Westeros* proudly proclaims itself “a *BattleLore* game,” which is being somewhat elastic with the truth as the game pretty much rewrites the rules of both *BattleLore* and **Command &amp; Colors** so much that only the basic elements remain in common.

For gameplay purposes, you play scenarios which pit two armies against one another. The base game allows you to play Stark vs. Lannister, but the expansions add the Baratheon and Tully forces, as well as the irregular forces of the Brotherhood Without Banners and the tribes of the Vale of Arryn. The scenario details tell you how to set up the map, which is a plain green field covered in hexes. You place hexagonal tokens on the map to depict scenery, such as hills, villages, mountains, rivers and forests (the *House Baratheon* expansion also features a second map, depicting the Blackwater Rush and the walls of King’s Landing), and set up your armies as directed. Each army consists of archers, infantry, cavalry and – most critically – “leaders.” These leaders are special units depicting the commanders of the armies in question, such as Robb Stark, Jaime Lannister, Brienne of Tarth, Shagga, Stannis Baratheon, Brynden the Blackfish and so on. These units are usually quite powerful in combat, but they also play an important role in giving orders to your troops (and getting them captured or killed can be a devastating blow).

The game’s biggest deviation away from the **Command &amp; Colors** system is that the board is not divided into sectors. Those games have a central sector and two flanks, and you draw cards telling you how many units in each sector you can use on that turn. *Battles of Westeros* replaces this with you playing cards as orders given by your leaders to troops within yelling distance. So, you play a card on a leader and he or she can direct units within 2 hexes of their figure. This is immediately more logical and also causes each player to carefully consider each turn how to manoeuvre their armies (and keep their leaders within order-giving range of their key troops without endangering them). Each turn you also get a number of general-purpose order tokens you can use to order any unit on the map, regardless of if they are in range of a leader or not, which is handy if you have a bunch of archers on a hill off to one side of the battlefield you want to take potshots at enemy forces without getting a general to ride over and keep telling them to do so.

Each leader also has special abilities, some they can use continuously and extremely powerful once-per-game abilities (such as allowing your troops to attack twice in one turn) that can prove decisive if used wisely.

There are additional rules for flanking enemy troops and veterancy: not all your troops are equal, with their experience denoted by the colour of their flag (green for fresh recruits, blue for experienced soldiers and red for veterans). That also determines how many dice they roll in attack and how far they move, with more experienced troops generally being slower but able to hit much harder. There is also a morale tracker, which swings back and forth determining on how the battle is going: lose too many units to the enemy without inflicting comparable damage and your army can rout altogether.

Despite this level of detail, *Battles of Westeros* is not a particularly complex game, especially if you have some previous experience of the **Command &amp; Colors** system. Most turns have you playing a card on a leader, moving the figures of the troops they are commanding and rolling dice to determine if they are successful, and that’s pretty much it, unless you want to use a special ability. You then draw some new cards, roll some dice to determine how many other units you can move and away you go. Each scenario has specific victory conditions or complications to add variety to the game, and each leader has their own set of cards which you can add to your command deck, which adds quite a bit of longevity and replay value to the game, which is increased even further by the expansions.

The game’s presentation is solid (Fantasy Flight has built up a beautiful library of **ASoIaF**\-related artwork over the last fifteen years), the rules are reasonably comprehensible and well-laid out, and the production value of the components is excellent. Most copies of the game you’ll find now are getting on for a decade, and every one I’ve seen has been in good nick. The cards are also good quality and the miniatures are impressive, although a little on the small side.

The rules are great, and if you’ve played a lot of **Command &amp; Colors** the changes will likely be welcome. In particular, tying the order cards to the leader figures rather than random sectors simply makes a hell of a lot more sense, and it’d be cool to see this idea moved over to some of the other games in the same line. Complete newcomers may find a slightly steeper hill to climb, but in overall terms and compared to many contemporary board games (especially those on the wargame side of things), the game is not particularly hard to learn.

The negatives are relatively minor, but there are a few niggles. The figures don’t fit into their bases very well, so it’s recommended you glue them in, which can be fiddly and time-consuming. The only reason they’re not pre-fitted to the bases is to make painting them easier, but the figures are small enough that I don’t really see the value of painting them. As a Fantasy Flight game there are also an absolute ton of fiddly tokens, symbols and paraphernalia, a lot of which are really unnecessary to the game. Another negative with the rules is that the game is extremely limited in counterattacking options, to the point where it very rarely happens. It feels like the idea of using order tokens to allow counterattacking (recently employed in *Red Alert*) should be implemented here.

Another issue is the length of gameplay. **Command &amp; Colors** is best-known for being relatively fast to play, especially versus traditional wargames, with it being possible to blast through say a few *Memoir ’44* scenarios in 30-45 minutes apiece. *Battles of Westeros* has no truck with this, and you’ll be lucky to get a scenario done in much under two hours. However, the much greater detail of the combat means you’ll be making much more interesting decisions than in a standard C&amp;C games, so the greater length can be seen as a reflection of the greater depth of gameplay. If you want a fast-playing wargame, break out *Memoir ’44*, if you want something a bit more detailed if slower then unleash *BattleLore* or *Red Alert*, but if you want something longer, meatier and more engrossing, *Battles of Westeros* works fine for that.

The biggest weakness is, of course, the lack of ongoing support. Despite the success of the TV show, Fantasy Flight have shown little interest in resurrecting the game and the recent release of CMON Games’ *A Song of Ice and Fire: The Tabletop Miniatures Game* (which has far more beautiful miniatures and considerably less-compelling rules) suggests they may no longer have the miniatures rights to do so. There are some online resources to extend the game and there are enough scenarios in the base game and expansions to ensure you will get a lot of value out of the game. 

*Battles of Westeros* (\*\*\*\*½) is a fine addition to any library of **ASoIaF**\-based games, or a solid 2-player wargame, if you can track down a copy at a good price.",0.049,0.803,0.148,0.9994,11.992799999999999
158,t3_ceqkie,Unpopular Opinion: Root actually isn't that good. Discuss!,0,"Hi all. So I bought into the Root hype and got super excited about it. Eventually I got the chance to play. I've played 2-player twice and 3-player once and my experiences have all been... meh. I feel like the unique(-ish) premise of having up to 4 factions playing by totally different rulesets sounds amazing in principle but underdelivers in practice. It's just not that exciting, and the game is not as deep as you'd imagine given the asymmetry. The factions, while very different from each other, are each kind of simplistic once you break it down. So ultimately you are left with a game that is less robust than conventional symmetric games, since it isn't more than the sum of its parts, or even just the sum of its parts: it feels like less than the sum of its parts because while there are many rules due to the separate faction rulesets, they don't add up to one rich system of rules but many light systems of rules that operate independently and don't apply to any one player all at once. The result is a game that never really gets that involving, because strategy is relatively limited and there is not a great deal to think about. 

Of course, this is all how it appears to me, and I am aware that others will have differing opinions and disagree, which is fine. I guess I just think the game is overrated &amp; over-celebrated. It's rare to read much criticism of it and I'm not sure why. My main positive take away is that it shows how asymmetry can work. Otherwise, it just doesn't seem that interesting to me.

Looking through some threads I think both of us didn't play a very optimal strategy, but for my wife, her engine petered out at the end leaving her pretty disappointed.  Basically in rounds 5 and 6 I ended up with a whole bunch more turns than her, and (my bad) I probably poured salt in the wound by racking up extra end game points.  I got to the top of the knowledge track at round 4 and then ended up with a bunch of extra actions.  Neither of us did a single Gaiaformer though which given the name of the game was probably bad play.

Currently this may be a game that she doesn't play again although I'm trying to convince her to give it one more go (she felt the end game was Monopolyesque--i.e. you're getting your butt kicked and there isn't anything you can do).  I just thought of an idea that we could play coop against the Automa to learn it better together also.

I've gotten to see the game several times as it's come along, and played it again last week, and it's a lot of fun.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a nice, tight worker placement game, with some really neat ideas. 

Basically, you have 4 workers, two engineers, and two administrators (or both of one type if you are playing on teams). Each type of worker does something different on each action space. You are trying to acquire resources and gain development cards to assist you in launching your missions, which is the main way you generate VP. 

&amp;#x200B;

The developments and astronauts also are kind of dual-use, which I am always a fan of.   


One of the things I really like is the ticking clock for the missions. The levels of success are interesting, and sometimes you are gambling that you can complete one before it launches and fails. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also really like the way you can upgrade resources to permanent resources that you can use over and over again.   


Overall I think it's a really well-designed game with a great balance of long term planning and grabbing short term rewards.

He said he would be interested in commissioning resin measuring sticks for Fallout: Wasteland Warfare, since he only has the cardboard kind. I feel like there's a common pain point here: board game companies not quite hitting the mark with their game pieces. To be fair, I'm sure most people play Batman with maybe 4 players.

Even though I love discovering new games, and playing them for the first time, I am finding that deciding what game to buy next is becoming more and more difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

How do you get over the paralysis? I’ll spend hours reading review after review, and watching video after video, because I have to convince myself that I need to buy the PERFECT game if I’m going to spend $30-50 on something, and dedicate time to introducing it to my wife/friends. How do you decide?

&amp;#x200B;

Reddit has been great for discovering games, but as you know, there are a million and one opinions about each game. Do you simply follow a few bloggers and tune everything else out?

&amp;#x200B;

How do you all get over the paralysis of what to buy next?

190,t3_cehutp,Merchants and marauders,22,Just wanted to share this because it’s hilarious but also frustrating. So I bought merchants and marauders online from bed bath and beyond because it was one of the only places I could find it. When it finally got shipped I was surprised to see how small the box was. I opened it to find a han solo figurine for imperial assault. Turns out merchants was out of stock and now I gotta try and get my money back. I’m just completely boggled on why they even sent a Han Solo figurine in place of an 80 dollar game.,0.089,0.854,0.057,-0.7391,-16.2602
191,t3_cepket,Need help with Azul default storage,2,"So, Azul comes with pretty neat insert. I can see, where almost all components should go. There are two circular recessions, where stacks of workshops sold go. Inside one of them, there's a container for first player tile. On top of them, there's space to fit the tile bag with tiles inside. Then, on top of it all, there's enough space to fit tableaus and manual.

But... I can't figure out, where the scoring tokens should go. I don't see any space that would be clearly dedicated for them. Currently I sure then inside the included zip bag and toss them in the recession with the game's name in it. But that's just a dumb placeholder solution. They fly all over that space like last couple of tic tacs in a box.

192,t3_cefse3,The Top 100 That No One Asked For: 100-91,31,"

I really got into the hobby around March 2017 when I received Small World, Lords of Waterdeep, and Betrayal at House on the Hill for my birthday. I had played games before, but didn’t start buying and really playing until around this time. In June 2017, I downloaded BG Stats and started recording my plays. On July 16, 2019, I hit 100 unique games played. This is my ranking of those games.

 

100\. **Munchkin** - 1 Play - I don’t know how a game this simple can have such a bad set of rules? I don’t know how a game with such a bad set of rules got so popular? I don’t know how a game this popular is so bad. I bought this game on a whim on vacation because it was early in my days in the hobby and thought, “all these people can’t be wrong.” I read the rules and instantly wondered what the point was. Munchkin will continue to print money and I’m happy for them, but this isn’t for me. I’ll refuse to play.

 

99\. **Monopoly Gamer** - 1 Play – This is still Monopoly, people. I bought this for my nephew for Christmas, so of course I had to play a game with him. While, the theme is awesome, the components are awesome, this game has no decisions. At least it was quick.

 

98\. **Holding On: The Troubled Life of Billy Kerr** - 4 Plays – One of my biggest disappointments in my board gaming life. I’m a sucker for unique theme and this had such an interesting one for me. The mechanics, however, are absolute trash. This is a luck fest, and if you fail a mission, you have to do it over and over and over and over again until you beat it. The story did seem cool, but you’re looking at the same cards every game and it was such a slog to get through. This game is for sale, if you’d like to try it after this glowing review.

 

97\. **Unicorn Glitterluck: Cloud Stacking** - 4 Plays – In sentimental value, this game is top 10. I bought this for my 2 year old daughter at Origins this year and she was so excited I brought her a game home. She always likes playing with my pieces, but now she had one of her own. She made it a point that it had to be on daddy’s shelf. I’ll cherish my memories of that moment and my plays of it, but this is still a game for toddlers.

 

96\. **One Night Ultimate Werewolf** - 1 Play – 1 play was enough for me, but I’m sure I’ll get comments saying it requires multiple plays. I don’t like that it’s 10 minutes. It’s social deduction, but no way to deduce who’s good and who’s bad socially. It starts with a guess and then 2 minutes of pandering. I would play this in a group if someone reallllly wanted to, but it just doesn’t interest me.

 

95\. **Jenga** - 4 Plays – The only way to play Jenga is to play Drinking Jenga. Put different tasks on each brick, when it’s pulled, whoever pulls it, does the task. My personal favorite block in my set is “Secret Terrorist”. The person who pulls it, writes down a word. If that word is said by any other player, they smack the tower as hard as they can.

 

94\. **Kingdom Builder** - 1 Play – Dave Luza is correct. This game is literal trash.

 

93\. **Tokaido** - 9 Plays – Pretty game, cool theme, blah, blah, blah. This game is just kind of…boring. Others describe it as chill. The expansion makes it a tiny bit better, but the choices are so easy. Go to the closest spot always, get points for everything. This was a gift and looks good on my shelf, only reason it stays. Can someone please tell me why this game gets so much love?

 

92\. **Small World** - 4 Plays (recorded) - One of my first favorite games. It reminded me a lot of my childhood favorite, Risk. I may say this more than once, I’m not sure, but VARIABILITY DOES NOT EQUAL REPLAYABILITY. The monster + power combos create variability, but they’re all pretty much the same. The area control is mundane and you really never have enough to hold on to anything. And I have to mention that you spend 1/3 of the game declining and not playing the game.

 

91\. **Ex Libris** - 2 Plays – Another huge disappointment for me. A game I was looking forward to for a long time because of the really unique them. This game has so much going on for how light it is. The worker placement is annoying because you’re constantly needing to read new buildings, even though they’re all pretty much the same. Remember, variability does not equal replayability (that was fast). Every spot is get more cards or rearrange your shelf. I like the tableau building with the books, but that adds about 5 things to remember for scoring too. You have to think about tableau building which scores for 3-5 different things, 10 placement spots that are constantly revolving, variable player powers for different workers for each player. It’s just so much for such a light game",0.067,0.724,0.209,0.9993,30.978299999999997
193,t3_cedjdx,I have been working on a Dota2 board game simulation for more than one year. I believe that the game is ready to be playtested by more people,50,"Hi,

So I posted about this 4-5 months ago to r/dota2 to show people the idea; however, what I had back then needed a lot of work. Now, I believe that the game is solid for an alpha, and I have it entirely implemented on TTS with everything already designed.

Instead of posting again to r/dota2, I thought it would be a better idea to see if dota2 players who already do boardgames would be interested.
I playtested the game for a long time with a small number of people. Many time I had to play two heroes instead of one because I didn't have enough players to playtest with, but since the game has matured a lot, I am hoping that it is good enough to be playtested by other people.

204,t3_cewlbw,Developer Diary for Werewolf vs. Vampire 3,6,"For some time now I've been writing a developer diary about my boardgame Werewolf vs. Vampire.

This is the 4th part (below I've linked the other parts):

## Day 12

After I found out yesterday that I got the wrong template from the manufacturer, I created my own one today.

I also started to place the graphics on the box layout.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the lap and the front have to overlap, I have to be extremely careful there, so that the finished product also looks the same.

&amp;#x200B;

Now it's time to think outside the box .

If you look at my design of the box, you can see that the front is only 8cm high and the back 10.4cm. Since the back, top and flap are made of one graphic, I have to go to 10.4cm for the front to place the graphic.

Quite an effort.

&amp;#x200B;

I also want the graphics to look a bit brighter where the lap overlays the front, just like on a real older box.

I have made a first draft and will get some feedback on how the box is received.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit more about the graphics:

Just like before it is necessary to include 3mm bleed and a safe margin, so that everything that belongs on one side is found there. But in the box design there is also the fact that a certain area folded inwards will land on the inside of the box. This is apparently called warp.

But so that I don't have the warp color on the outside, I left myself a 3mm edge, which is in the outside color.

&amp;#x200B;

## Day 13

Today was a really exhausting day.

Usually I have an 8 hour day earning money.But today was my day off and I found time to fully concentrate on the game.

Fortunately, Karsten from Stimulus-Games spend a lot of time with me (Karsten is the creator of Movie Empire).

Wow - the logo has improved by another 600% (thanks to Karsten) and I really managed to do a lot fo things with the box design.

[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1B0e\_QXXMsLd\_Mg4LHSmYUYthD7eTFTvH](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1B0e_QXXMsLd_Mg4LHSmYUYthD7eTFTvH)

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, I bought my barcode today (5 pieces for 10 Euro - needed later for Amazon, Ebay...) and already inserted it.

&amp;#x200B;

## Day 14

Not so much happened today. I printed a MiniBox and put it together.

&amp;#x200B;

Building it I wanted to check whether everything is on the real 3D object as I imagined it to be.Unfortunately, I noticed that I put the backside upside down and a design element on the wrong side.

So, I rearranged everything and now it looks good.

&amp;#x200B;

Next I updated the offer.Since I printed out all game pieces with the 3D printer and partly provided them with the right color, 3 dimensions have changed. E.g., the paths become a bit thicker, but not as thick as the locations.

&amp;#x200B;

And I would like more velvet bags so that everything in the box keeps its place.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I now have good graphics for almost everything, I attached them directly to the mail to the producer.I have attached the Mini Box for you.

The games in question were **Warhammer: Invasion**, **X wing**, **Mage Wars: Academy**, **Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn**, ** Transformers TCG**, **Heroclix**, **Dice Masters** and finally **Infinity**. Apart from Warhammer Invasion which I still enjoy despite it being done and Xwing, I have played zero or one of every other game of the above. (I'm not into the competitive scene by the way.) And that is because they are not simple games to tackle with.

Besides them requiring quite a lot of money spent on them, which you either have or don't,  there are other things which separate them from normal board games. They require some time to understand the rules and deal with the usually long and ever expanding FAQ. Then play some games and read the rules and FAQ again. Then try to come up with strategies and building lists and decks, which for some, me included, is half the fun. And on top of that, having someone else as involved as you are in all of that, because all of these are kind of lifestyle games more or less and you want someone who will have spent the same amount of time and money to face as an opponent.

218,t3_ceugbx,Do Spirit Island Events Disproportionately Punish Slow Spirits?,3,"I got my wife Spirit Island and Branch &amp; Claw for her birthday last week. We love it, absolutely love it. However. Many of the events seemed to punish spirits which operate on the slow side, at least disproportionately to those that would punish fast. I understand that events occur after the Fast phase and before the Slow, so I can see some reason that would happen.

But she was playing Vital Strength of the Earth, a very slow Spirit and very defense heavy. We continued to pull events that said something like ""pay 3 coins per slow power or discard that power"" or that would buff enemies. If you're only playing slow powers and have them calculated to the strength of the invaders in that land and then the invaders are suddenly health +1, your turn is suddenly entirely wasted. Or things where we were able to provide additional defense in lands or remove an Explorer. Those aren't bad things, but she still felt punished and somewhat useless because the events kept punishing her or invalidating her actions.

Granted, we have only played 2 games with the events. Does it get better, or are a lot of the events built such that a predominantly slow Spirit is going to suffer?",0.119,0.737,0.144,-0.2237,-0.6711

Our solution is to have bench seating that can be pushed underneath the table when not in use. Another hope of ours is that it will have some sort of storage to hide away game accessories. We've already run out of shelving storage for our games and I hate having things tossed about on the floor.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm running into a few problems:

* Looked into piano benches first (due to their storage) but none that I find have a 45-60"" width
* Storage benches aren't often used for main dining/seating so it is hard to find ratings on their comfort levels
* Must be able to be used for long durations

223,t3_cems5f,[Root] Beginner Faction Guide Advice,24,"Root is not mechanically all that difficult to teach.  What makes it complex are the factions.  Not only do you have to understand what your faction needs to do to win, you also need to understand what to do to prevent the other factions from winning. 

For new players, this is simply too much to consider for the first few games. They tend to look entirely inward and are largely unaware of the actual state of the game in terms of which faction is the most likely to win at any given time.  I think this can be off-putting to some people.  To help alleviate this issue, I wrote a basic guide on How to Play and How to Beat each faction, and am considering printing it out and giving it to each player.  Of course I'll explain the mechanical rules as well, but this will simply be used as a reference so they have a better understanding of the game state at any given time.  I want advice as to whether or not this a good idea.  Would this ruin the experience or negatively effect some factions more than others?

I had played games before, but didn’t start buying and really playing until around this time. In June 2017, I downloaded BG Stats and started recording my plays. On July 16, 2019, I hit 100 unique games played. This is my ranking of those games.

 

I’m putting the number of plays for each game so that you may see at what point my judgment is coming from. Sometimes a game needs multiple plays, sometimes one is enough.

100-91:
https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/cefse3/the_top_100_that_no_one_asked_for_10091/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

 

90\. **Qwirkle** - 1 Play (recorded, but many more than that) – I am bad at this game. My wife always crushes. It’s just shapes and colors? No. It’s crap and garbage. Now, this game isn’t low because I’m bad. I swear. I’m not THAT bitter. This game just doesn’t do anything for me. Is anyone ever excited to play Qwirkle? This game is now blocks for my daughter to build towers with. Congrats Qwirkle, you’ve staved off elimination with toddler immunity.

 

89\. **Meeple Circus** - 1 Play – I played this at Origins this year. I had this game built up so much in my group as this game we had to get. I just never wanted to spend $50 on it. I would try and make bets where the loser had to buy Meeple Circus. I just had to stack an elephant meeple on a tiger on a strong man. But man, it was underwhelming. I think if I was given this game, I’d play it for stupid fun about once every 6 months, but this is definitely not worth spending money on.

 

88\. **Blokus** - 1 Play (recorded, but many more than that) – I’ve said “Don’t talk shit about Blokus” more than once to my friends. This game is fine, I’m actually probably more willing to play it than other games above it. It’s just not exciting. Blokus is green beans. There’s nothing offensive about it, but I’m never going choose put it on my plate. Please don’t @ me about green beans.

 

87\. **Dominion: Intrigue** - 1 Play – This went over so well I don’t even remember playing it. I’ve played regular Dominion too (that’s obviously higher up). I must’ve just had a bad experience with these sets of cards. I dunno. Just play base Dominion

 

86\. **Covert** - 2 Plays – Both these plays were at 2 players. I wonder if this would be better at more players. My friend bought this game, we learned it on the spot and he’s never brought it up again. He’s left all of his games at my house…except this one. Sometimes I wonder if this game is Covert is actually a spy and it’s ran off to do its next spy thing, but more than likely it’s in the trash can.

 

85\. **Smash Up** - 1 Play – I played this game on the tail end of a decathalon (10 games in a day) and it was the only game that divulged into a quasi-argument. Possibly because it had been 14 hours with the same people, but that just left a bad taste in my mouth. I don’t get offended by being attacked in other games or take that, but something happened that game. I could see this game being fun. If I owned it, I bet it would rise up.

 

84\. **Five Tribes** - 8 Plays – I put this game in my 10x10 this year and due to this, Five Tribes has fallen about 50 spots. Players with AP kill this game…absolutely kills it. This game should’ve come with a sand timer. If you don’t make a move in 30 seconds, you lose a billion coins. You may remember from the last 10 that VARIABILITY DOES NOT EQUAL REPLAYABILITY. This is the poster child. Set up is always different, different djinns, market row…ton of variability. The optimal strategy stays the same though. Don’t bid high, something will be there for you. Go for green and set collect as much as possible. As soon as I’m finished with my 10x10, this game is going gone.

 

83\. **Risk** - 1 Play (recorded, but many more than that) – This is what I did in high school. My friends would come over every Saturday and we played Risk. I loved Risk so much. It felt like war. I don’t get the whole “I don’t like game X because it didn’t make me feel like a coal miner.” It’s a board game! You’re pushing around cardboard and plastic! But Risk did make me feel like a war strategist. It just doesn’t hold up now that I’ve played other games. It’s too long. It’s too luck dependent. It’s too king-making. And if anyone is going to be king-making, it’s going to be me (my last name is King and I’ve made 2 Kings).

 

82\. **Risk Legacy** - 8 Plays – It ends faster? This is hurt because I played Pandemic Legacy before this game, but man, there’s not much to it. I expected story. I expected wholesale changes every game. This just doesn’t deliver. Only 7 more plays to go…oh my gosh…7 more plays.

 

81\. **12 Days** - 12 Plays (that’s weird) – On the 5th day of Christmas my true love gave to me…would you look at that? It’s…it’s another 11. Who would have thought? This is the 5th 11 I’ve been passed. I love Christmas. I’m like a 10 year old at Christmas. I like getting gifts, I like giving gifts, I like the songs, and I like the movies. And I do like playing 12 Days around the holidays. But the game ain’t great, folks. But its 15 minutes and it’s got a fun theme and it’s a little different than other stuff I’ve played.

1. Determining how to best plant vines in your fields
2. Planning out your entire year upfront, due to your limited workers that need to be planned out for all seasons

I think the difficulty lies more with #2. We've never played a game that relied on you determining so precisely how you're gonna play out your turn. In most board games, you either have some broad strategy to play out or you just focus on your best available play on your turn.

246,t3_ceryr0,"Arkham Horror LCG in comparison to Eldritch/Arkham/Mansions, your thoughts?",23,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I really enjoy playing games in the Lovecraft universe and I also like to play 2 player games every now and then so I really had to buy the Arkham Horror LCG when I got the chance. I already own Eldritch Horror and often play Mansions of Madness 2nd Edition so I was interested where this would fit in to the collection. However, after playing the first campaign through maybe 4 times I really cannot see where all the hype is coming from so I want to hear from others what it is that they like about the game. I will list some of the reasons why I like the other two much better.

&amp;#x200B;

**Set Up:** The LCG has a VERY large setup and pack away time in my opinion, and it at least feels that it takes as long as Eldritch to set up and certainly longer than Mansions.

**Story:** I was fairly underwhelmed with the story side of the LCG. Much of the flavour text is repeated in one paragraph or two in 2 or 3 different locations. There is some branching of paths but it feels very minimal to me. In contrast, I think that the storytelling in Mansions is far superior and that the story really drives the game forward. Some of the newer scenarios in particular are amazing.

**Character Development:** In the LCG character development is mostly done by modifying your deck. To me this feels underwhelming because one might add 2 or 3 cards over the course of a campaign and you may never in see them in your playthrough, as the decks are quite large. In contrast I find the character development in Eldritch very exciting because you find a lot of items that drastically change play, new spells, and improving skills has a huge impact.

**Cost:** This is a big one, probably the biggest. A 4 player version of the LCG costs something like 70 euro (having to buy 2 copies of the game). This is more expensive than either Eldritch or Mansions and has SO many fewer pieces AND scenarios. This includes one campaign with three missions. The value from Eldritch or Mansions seems far superior to me.

**Replayability:** I think that the LCG does have a good amount of replayability. You can play with different combinations of the 4 characters and try to figure out ways to win with those combinations. However, there is only one story in the box and the branching paths are very minimal. Mansions has I think 5 scenarios out of the box and new ones are much cheaper than the LCG expansions. Eldritch is not so story based so the comparison is not entirely fair but it does come with 4 elder gods and I think 12 characters so the replayability is much higher in my opinion. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, in conclusion I find that the LCG sits somewhere between Eldritch and Mansions. However, if you like the storytelling side then you are better off with mansions, if you prefer the character development side then go with Eldritch. Not to mention that both of these are, in my opinion, MUCH better value for money than the LCG. I am very interested to hear from others who have played other games in the universe and why they think that the LCG is the superior game.

And the other way around, what game(s) were you not so sure of but became an unexpected surprise? 

A game that didn’t meet its expectations for me is Troyes. Everything appealed to me: the mechanisms, artwork, weight,...  And I was looking forward to it! Man, I was hyped! 

But after my first play it is just.. fine? I guess? It is a good game. And I will play it again eventually. But damn. That game did not meet my expectations. Which is a bummer.

On the other side. A game where I have low expectations fir was Burgle Bros. I don’t know. It didn’t appeal to me at first. Bland art. Small box. Mechanisms that weren’t my thing at that time. 

Now... I don’t just own it. I freaking love it. It’s my 3th favourite game of all time. I do own other co-ops like Spirit Island (which I also enjoy very very much) but non is a fantastic as Burgle Bros.

An app to help you find games to play,20,"A few friends and I have put together a little open source mobile and web app to help people choose games from their collection, their friends collections and any geeklists they have set up. We had a use case that unfortunately great tools like Cardboard Butler didn't quite cater for. We have a collection of games sat in a locker that we play regularly at lunchtime. We didn't want to just keep rerolling on these apps so we decided to contribute, create our own and keep the codebase open so other fellow gamers can suggest features and contribute to help make board gamer's lives better.

The app is currently on Android and is available via https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sixfootsoftware.howmanymobilemeeple

We also have a web front-end at http://how-many-meeple.sixfootsoftware.com

I strongly suggest you check out the **part 1**, where I explain wtf is going on here.

When we last left off we were finishing up the campaign, fighting the gauntlet of Nemesis boss-fights before taking on the Great Devourer. We'd assembled our mightiest heroes: [Patrick the Reflective Starfish, Sailor Moon (without a face), DW the Refractive Anteater, and Nigel Thornberry (wearing Sailor's Moon's face aka the Forsaker Mask).](https://i.imgur.com/MhG3hLk.jpg)

We'd lost a few of our other favourite heroes. Sailor Moon had cut off her own face due to the grief of witnessing her father [Morty lose his face to the Butcher](https://i.imgur.com/WjSPIMe.jpg). And during a fight with the Kingsman [Yogi Bear had died from a brutal coup-de-grace](https://i.imgur.com/2Chatm8.jpg), even after leaning the secrets of the King's Step.

All that was left was the final fight with the Great Devourer. Poor Nigel Thornberry was in rough shape, partly transformed into a new Kingsman. His torso, arms, and legs had already transformed into regal Kingsman armour, and his face remained always covered by Sailor Moon's Forsaker Mask. [His waist was the only part of him that remained human and unarmoured (NSFW).](https://i.imgur.com/7GWdtzp.jpg)

Our artist only drew one scene from the final battle, in which we were eventually successful. Nigel Thornberry took a particularly vicious hit from the Sunstalker god. So vicious, in fact, that [he was knocked back out of his own shadow (also NSFW)](https://i.imgur.com/m6vn8zW.jpg). Wtf is going on here, you ask? To answer, you need to have a look at the Sunstalker enemy that we were fighting [(it's a dick monster)](https://i.redd.it/g7mkb5xwzuv01.png).

We were thus victorious, our campaign completed... or was it?

266,t3_cf36ms,Wingspan - Hits the Table Hard!,7,"*** This is my review/thoughts after playing the game for a few months.***

Pros:
-Fast paced. (With each player taking one action per turn, there is very little down time in between turns.)

-Mostly well balanced. (Although not all birds are created equal, more on this in the cons, I felt they did a good job with most of the bird powers to keep most games from having a runaway winner.)

-Artwork and overall aesthetics. (The eggs, dice, bird house, and everything else look amazing!)

-Theming. (Again, between the amazing artwork and the high quality components this game has excellent theming! They even take it a step further with facts being at the bottom of every bird card in the game as well as where they are found around the world.)

- Cards galore! (With 170 unique bird cards it gives the game massive replay value.)


Cons:
-Egg spamming is no joke! (I found the entire final round we would all simply lay eggs making it kind of an uneventful end to the game.)

-Not all abilities are created equal. (I’m looking at you tuck a card, draw a card. Get a few of these and a repeat a brown power bird and victory is yours.)

-Box organization isn’t the best. (Im not a huge fan of loose components, but this is really more of a nitpick).

-Only two of the habitats are any good. (You really only need one bird in the water habitat if that. Drawing bird cards are necessary, but laying eggs, gaining food, and playing birds are where the real points are.)

276,t3_c5zgf2,"I ran a ""mini-megagame"" for my kids summer camp and it was a blast!",211,"Last week I ran my usual June martial arts summer camp. We were scheduled to go play in the park one morning, but got rained out. Fortunately, I'd set a contingency should this happen: a ""megagame.""

I made a [YouTube summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpmPhlgquc8&amp;feature=youtu.be) of it, but for those who would rather read: I pitched it to the kids as ""like a boardgame, except you're the pieces. You will all be generals moving around trying to conquer territory. We'll play for about an hour and whoever has conquered the most territory at the end OR who has conquered the other team's capital will win. Sound good?""

Martial arts tends to attract introverts, often the nerdy variety (such as myself), so most of them were excited, others went along because kids just do that, and the rest did because everyone else was. There were 15 kids in camp that day, aged 6-12. With an odd number and the oldest kid looking skeptical, I made an on-the-fly modification to what I'd jotted down for the rules: one team would have a king who had no power, but would be the big-picture person who could walk around and suggest where the other kids should be going and aiming for.

I asked for volunteers and got three (the three I expected would). I put the oldest (previously skeptical) one as the sole king on one side, the two younger ones as ""dual kings"" on the other. Boy did leadership have a huge effect!

[Early in the game](https://imgur.com/S8vsKNx)

I won't dive into the full nitty-gritty of the game, but there were red and white teams, each with wiffle golf balls for armies (we normally use them for bullets and the like in other games). Each general got a d6, 3 armies, to start and could move 1 mat ""square"" per turn, optionally leaving an army behind to control it. Moving through a square already controlled gave an extra movement.

Objectives were forts, villages, a port, monsters to fight for unknown rewards, and the other team. At castles, forts, and villages, players could attempt to recruit more armies instead. One of my assistant instructors roamed handling the dice rolls for white team, while I did the same for red and handled any combats.

While some kids focused on expanding territory, the focus of both teams was to take the ports and when the first was conquered, I told them about ships and the far island with a giant guarding a powerful artifact. Both teams built their first, turned a general into an admiral, and sent them off towards the island. After a sea battle, red's admiral had to retreat onto a reef (a sai laid in an ocean ""square"") and lost everything, giving white dominance of the deep sea and the island. This turn eventually led to red's victory.

[The serpent driven to white's capitol. Admirals in the far distance heading for the island](https://imgur.com/yJGI22W)

With the island in white hands, red's (brilliant) king decided they needed to decisively crush the poorly-defended white capitol before white beat the giant and got the artifact with whatever power it gave. He organized and orchestrated a perfectly timed meeting of three generals adjacent to the white capitol at the same time two ships from the other side of the game world landed on a beachhead at the capitol's rear.

The white kings were both hanging out at the island, excited about the giant and didn't notice the approach and buildup until their capitol was under attack from 5 generals and \~25 armies against their defense of a castle, 2 generals, and &lt;10 armies.

White rushed all their mainland generals to help and had some lucky rolls that let them hold out longer than expected against the red juggernaut, but were on the brink of losing when the two admirals across the game world took out the giant and claimed its artifact, giving them extra dice in combat and also allowing them to fly!

[Fighting the giant](https://imgur.com/obaf0gP)

They could have swooped in and conquered the completely undefended red capitol, but instead dropped their troops at their capitol, taking the numeric odds from 5:1 to 3:1 against them. Even with the power of the artifact, the odds were too great and they were buried under the red juggernaut.

The game ended up lasting \~2 hours with even the 6 year-olds locked-in the whole time. The only one who got bored was the red king who, after seeing his final plan was in motion, headed off to beat up a Wavemaster for the last half-hour, returning only briefly when white's admirals flew in. He prudently directed a general to protect their capitol against white realizing they could fly there, then returned to his attack on the Wavemaster.

Overall, the game was a great hit! With a few post-game tweaks and improvements it's now my new go-to activity if we get rained out of the pool or park!

Hello beautiful humans of r/boardgames!

I love board games. They've had my heart since my friend dragged me to the board game club at my undergrad and got me to play Terra Mystica with him. He also only half taught it, let me be Chaos Magicians on my first go, said it didn't matter where I started, and immediately backed me into a corner making for a horrific game. BUT I WAS HOOKED and needed to figure out the game and then more and more games. So many games.

In fact I was buying more games from my local shop when I overheard another customer be mocked by their friend and a an employee for buying a party game.He was met with comments like ""Oh, he's new to gaming"" and ""he'll get there.""

Please stop doing this to our new folk. Everyone is new to gaming at some point. It can be fun to explore new and increasingly more complex games. It can also be fun to whip out Exploding Kittens and Coup. A lot of these serve as gateway games that get people more involved. Don't make them feel more excluded from the beginning.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now, you're allowed to be uninterested in playing these games. There are hundreds of games I would rather play than Catan for instance. So many games I think are leagues better even at the same difficulty level. Heck, I'd rather play Twilight Imperium three times in a row on no sleep then sit through another game of Catan in my life, however, when someone tells me they love it, I say ""awesome, it's considered a modern classic for a reason!"" And then I recommend something else they may also like to see if they are willing to try.**

**Never yuck the yum of someone else. Be nice to the people who are entering gaming. I've met so many people that will said they were intimidated by the gaming community. Be bright and welcoming and meet them where they are. Small comments matter. How we talk about things we don't like matters. Spread the love of gaming, don't squash it.**

&amp;#x200B;

**And for the love of all things holy, don't let a newbie be Chaos Magicians on their first Terra playthrough.**

[https://imgur.com/a/yMnagM9](https://imgur.com/a/yMnagM9)

Hey everyone, long time subscriber to /bg but I don't post much. I've gone through a few buying/selling waves, and I finally feel as though things are right where I want them. I go through having interest in a lot of games, to over-purchasing and being stressed out about the amount of games not being played. I've tried very intentionally over the last year to ONLY have on-hand what I actually want as part of my permanent collection. Twilight Imperium was the hardest to get rid of, but I honestly feel more free mentally now that it's gone :)

&amp;#x200B;

Recently got rid of:

\- 7th continent

\- Gloomhaven

\- Descent 2nd Ed.

&amp;#x200B;

How long have I ben in le hobby: I would say probably 8-10 years since I bought Catan for the first time, but it really ramped up to a main source of entertainment in the past 4-5 years

&amp;#x200B;

What would I change about my collection: I don't feel like I would change much at this point. I got rid of Gloomhaven recently, which was another weight off of my shoulders

&amp;#x200B;

Interesting tidbits: I'm in the process of magnetizing all of the Kingdom Death Armor sets, which is turning out to be a very challenging and rewarding process!

&amp;#x200B;

Not pictured: Monikers (not sure where it is at the moment)

&amp;#x200B;

Unplayed:

\- Shadows of Brimstone (just got a few weeks ago)

\- Sword &amp; Sorcery (just got a few weeks ago)

&amp;#x200B;

Centerpiece:- KDM for sure

\- Titan and High Frontier as runner ups

&amp;#x200B;

Waiting on KS:

\- Eclipse 2nd Ed

\- Space Race

\- Considering Middara 

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE: I figured I would expand a bit on a couple things, as well as some lists I forgot to mention

Hardest games to get rid of:

* TI4: It's everything I've ever wanted in a game, but after 10+ plays I felt like I've seen all it has to offer, and I didn't want to invest more time going through the same frustrations/negotiations/etc for that length of time. If they ever choose to expand it, and I really hope they do, then I will probably go all-in again
* Dark Souls: I love the video game, and I went in on the KS. I had to get rid of it for financial reasons at the time, but I really wanted to learn it with some house rules to correct what people didn't like about it. But then again, I feel that KDM gives me the feel that I was going for by wanting that game.

&amp;#x200B;

Decision making process when buying a new game, or deciding what to keep/get rid of:

* first and foremost: Theme. That's the single most important factor for me. I LOVE space, scifi, and horror, so those games immediately grab me. After that is fantasy, and then things drop off from there.
* Second, I want there to be potential for experiencing new content. If I've felt like I've seen all that a game has to offer, then I quickly wonder if it has a lasting place in my collection. For KDM, I feel like I've barely scratched the surface, and the content (adventures) still to come excite me a lot. For games like TI4 and GH, I felt like I've seen it and experienced it, and didn't want to muster up the mental energy to get back into those worlds for just more of the same.

&amp;#x200B;

Oddballs:

* I've kept Talisman and Formula D for nostalgic reasons. I loved them when I was starting out, and I still think of those games very fondly. Plus selling them wouldn't get me much $, so for now they are there as relics of the past. I still get anxious about seeing un-played games on my shelf where I'm really conscious about QUANTITY and excess, but hey, for now they've managed to stay.

Noting that it was our first playthrough we realize that there were things that the alien could and needs to do on the first turn. Such as locking down the Rover ASAP, but hindsight is always 20/20. 

But here comes the title of the post, we noticed that since we played with fewer players, 3 hunted vs the alien. That the chance of the hunted escapes each round gets radically higher. Since the alien starts with two tokens only, if the hunted played well to diversify their selections and saved their survival cards the alien can be evaded consistently. 

Have you guys encountered this scenario with the alien having a tougher time vs a smaller team of hunted? What house rules would you suggest to even out the imbalance. The hunted survived with the alien only assimilating twice.

It also felt like the phases on the hunt cards for the alien could be redone since some of them would be better in other phases. 

Again this is pondering is only off of one first time play through, but our group is a small group so any input on this would be welcome.",0.008,0.812,0.18,0.9901,1.9802
295,t3_c6ijhm,Kingdomino (x2) or King + Queendomino for 4+ players,11,"Hey, i am just starting to build a small collection of board games and looking for some great games.  


**Introduction:**

I am looking for games that you can learn quick and play right away even with new players.  
But at the same time having played many PC games with a lot of complexity  
(Strategy like Civilizations, ARPGs like Diablo II and Path of Exile and games like Factorio).  
So i also love complex game mechanics.  


I started about 2-3 weeks ago looking for something one could play when we have guests.  
First thing i bought is Machi Koro which checks al the marks we were looking for.  
Easy to teach, quick to start and beginners don't get destroyed by experienced players.  
Only negative thing is that sometimes you get so many buildings that you need a lot of space on the table.

&amp;#x200B;

Then just recently i bought Carcassonne which i think can be perfect because it's still easy to teach and you can start quick enough while it has more complexity which i like. Gonna test it on the weekend.  


For the future I also put Terra Mystica and Spirit Island on my list fore more complex games that can be played when we have more time and look for something more challenging.  


**Kingdomino:**  
Now that you know a little about our background, I found out about Kingdomino just recently and thought about adding it to the collection of games that can be quickly explained and started with guests.  
But we want to be able to also play games when we are more then 4.  


So we were wondering if we should get 2x Kingdomino or 1x Kingdomino and 1x Queendomino.  


I read that many don't like Queendomino because it takes away the simplicity of Kingdomino.  
But i myself like it a little more complex and was wondering if it would be so much more difficult to teach it to new players.

&amp;#x200B;

If we go for 2x Kingdomino i'm afraight that it could get boring too quick.  
But when we get 1 King and 1 Queen i was wondering if it would become to complicated to quickly start with new players.  


Though i guess that if we'd start with King + Queen with more then 4 players, we could play 1 round without the queen rules to introduce them to the base mechanics and then add the queen rules. The first round the red tiles would be completely useless but i think for the purpose of teaching that would be fine.  


So what are your thoughts someone who is just starting with boardgames should get?

302,t3_c6h8k4,Impressions of Fast Forward FORTUNE - another fun Friedemann Friese title,11,"**Another great title in the series of Fast Forward games**

This is the fourth title in the ""Fast Forward"" series of games from Friedemann Friese, so if you've already played two other titles in that series (FEAR and FORTRESS), then [**Fast Forward FORTUNE**](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/2218050) will definitely give you a sense of the familiar.  Like FORTRESS, FORTUNE requires you to get specific combinations of cards.  And like FEAR, it requires you to compare hands when something is triggered. But it's the combination of these elements that makes FORTUNE feel new.

Once again the ""fable system"" of this game means that you learn how to play it on the fly, with special cards explaining the rules.  Much of the fun is about discovering how the game ebbs and flows as new rules get added, and the trajectory of the game-play keeps altering.  The gameplay is very easy for first-timers to follow, especially the basic concept of collecting the best three card hand to win. But then the game ramps up with some interesting scoring elements that are borrowed from games like Blackjack, or tinker with the scoring in other ways.

The theme of FORTUNE is related to the spinning wheels of a casino slot machine.  The actual game-play fits with the ""fortune"" theme very well, because it creates a light and frenzied feel that does bring to mind the slots.  You do have objectives to aim for, but because these can suddenly change, you are being bounced around in an entertaining ride.

**Recommendation:** If you have already tried the other titles in the Fast Forward series, but found them not to be your cup of tea, then Fast Forward FORTUNE won't convince you otherwise, because it's more or less in the mould of some of the other games in this series.  But if you already enjoyed FEAR and FORTRESS, you're almost certain to like this one as well. And if you haven't played any of the series at all, this is as good a place to start as with any of the others.  Even for those who aren't big fans of these games will admit that the game design here is truly unique.  If you're a gamer, you owe it to yourself to at least try one title in this series, to see what the fuss is all about, and FORTUNE is as good a choice as any of them.

This is something that I see in many places and in many texts on the subject, and it's been bugging me for a while, so apologies if it's already been covered to death elsewhere (but please provide me a link as I'd love to follow any other discussions on the subject).

Now, I'm not a new gamer by any means, but neither am I a super dedicated one. Life has moved on and these days I'm in my late 30s, I have a family with young kids, and pets, and a demanding job, and plenty of other hobbies that don't involve gaming in any manner whatsoever. This means that the D&amp;D all-nighters of my youth are gone, and I simply don't have the time or budget to invest in lengthy, complex games that take hours for a single session.

This means that things in categories like ""party games"" and ""gateway games"" are perfect for me. They don't cost the earth or eat up all of my free time. I can teach them to newer gamers quite easily, in some cases play with my older kids, and for my more experienced gamer friends they represent a way to fit several games into an otherwise relatively short game night.

As an example of what prompted me to write this post, sometimes I come across comments like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c5u0ny/be_nice_to_new_gamers_please_dont_yuck_the_yum_of/) in a recent discussion:

&gt;I overheard another customer be mocked by their friend and an employee for buying a party game. He was met with comments like ""Oh, he's new to gaming"" and ""he'll get there.""

Okay, that's a horrible unFLGS, because you don't have to be new or inexperienced to enjoy a party game, and I think we can all agree on the wrongness of this behaviour. But the OP there also continued to say:

&gt;Please stop doing this to our new folk. Everyone is new to gaming at some point. It can be fun to explore new and increasingly more complex games. It can also be fun to whip out Exploding Kittens and Coup. A lot of these serve as gateway games that get people more involved.

The message is well-meant. But while he was attacking the awful behaviour of the people at the game store, he was also reinforcing the existing bias that *party games and gateway games are only for people who are new and learning about gaming*, and even the term ""gateway game"" itself suggests that it's an intermediate step, before you get into ""real"" games.

I understand the history of the term and it is generally the case that these are lower-complexity games that really do serve this purpose, but what bugs me is the implication that you *ought to* move on from such games and onto ""proper"" games, only bringing them out again for newbies or at parties. I'm sure many ""real"" gamers would frown at my collection of mostly gateway and party games, and tell me haughtily that I'm not a real gamer because I don't have anything that can't be played in under three hours.

But you know what? I like these games. I don't play them to prove some point to myself, or my friends, or to show how advanced I am as a gamer. I play the games that I play because they are fun, and they are social, and they don't eat into time I don't have. And I don't see them as in any way inferior. Sure, I'm no stranger to things like *Twilight Struggle* and I'd play longer and more complex games if I had the time - but even if I did, I don't always want that. So can we all get off our collective high horses about gateway games and party games and just accept that they are as good as any other game?

311,t3_c67tju,Near and Far - A disappointing review of the campaign and gameplay,28,"I remember the excitement, when I unwrapped the extremely heavy box on my birthday, that I had upon seeing that my wife had gotten me **Near and Far** for me. I had heard many great reviews of this game, praising the art and the story, and we couldn't wait to get a game of it in. 

We started the tutorial and had a blast. And the reviewers weren't kidding about the art. It was a visual feast, with interestingly drawn characters, beautiful maps, a huge book of quests, with choices to make. It was an absolute blast. We decided right then and there, that instead of Pandemic Legacy Season One, we were going to play this campaign instead.

And now, since we finished it last night, I can't help but say that I'm disappointed. After a few plays, you've seen literally everything the game has to offer mechanically. You have few interesting gameplay choices, as you're routed through a routine again and again that can have some variation, but nothing that is really that interesting mechanically. 

But that's ok right? This game has amazing art and is all about the story right? And it does have some interesting lore, pulling off some very cool world-building. You'll be introduced to characters who keep popping up, make interesting quest decisions, and be ever further driven towards the final goal of reaching the last map in the campaign, the Lost Ruins.

And none of it really matters. Sadly, all the quests feel like MMO sidequests, with little depth beyond making a choice for positive rep and rewards or negative rep and rewards. You'll be introduced to big bads, who are built up over multiple games, finally confronting them.....only to find out they are weaker than the toughest opponents in the game, barely get a paragraph to wrap up their ""story"" and then do quests that talk about them as if they are still around.

Indeed, people will plead with you to perform some tasks that don't happen, indeed, nothing of interest happens, there is no special end of campaign wrap up, nothing that ties up the campaign and finishes the story. You've just won or lost yet another game that basically played like all the others, except you could fight a boss (again, who is weaker than the toughest one you can normally encounter) and gain some VP.

As some people might have noticed in my posts in the ""What did you play last week"" - the game had been grating on me since about halfway through the campaign (10 games, not counting the tutorial). Honestly, we probably only kept whacking at it due to sunk cost fallacy. We thought, perhaps foolishly, at the the final map would be epic. 

It was just more of the same, and that samey-ness is in all aspects of the game. If there were more quest chains (easily the best parts of the game), an epic finale, or quite simply ""more"" to the game, I think it could have been so great.

I do want to state that we have not played any of the character games (in them, instead of doing quests based off of the map, you run through a set number of quests that deal specifically with your character) and perhaps those would have been better. I don't know, but maybe we'll eventually give them a try, maybe in a while. I will give them props, they give you plenty of variety of ways to play the game, but it'll be a bit before we'll see if they are worth trying.

**Near and Far** - It's a good enough game, but you'll see all it has to offer long before you finish the campaign",0.074,0.756,0.169,0.9969,27.9132

[Part 5 (Final) - Iterate, Iterate, Iterate](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/cakhsi/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_5_final_iterate_iterate/)

Hey all. I’m back with another semi-weekly article on the journey of creating a home-brew Spirit. After coming up with an idea for a Spirit, I had to do additional research in order to make sure that the idea fit thematically.

**Thematic Research**

I started with a simple google search. Something along the lines of “phenomenon found in deserts” and went from there. From the list of resulting sites I made a list of ideas that could potentially be used to create a desert/antlion based Spirit:

* Oasis
* Mirage
* Haboob/Sandstorm
* Desert Heat
* Cactus
* Desert Varnish
* Flash Floods
* Quicksand

Then I decided to figure out the play style. My initial reaction was to embrace the antlion fantasy of gathering in Invaders and then destroying them. Both would most likely be Innate Powers. In order to facilitate that, I needed a Special Rule (or two) that would allow the theme to come through into the mechanical realm of the game.

So I settled on the following Special Rules:

1. Presence can only be placed in the Sands.
2. When Presence is placed, gather 1 Explorer or 1 Town or 1 Dahan into that same land.
   1. Note: The astute player will notice that there is definitely something wrong with this Special Rule, but we’ll get into that in a later article.

Then I decided to get a little weird and add one more that I thought might be interesting.

* Plant and Water Elements count as Sun instead.

I wanted the Spirit to be unique and play differently, and to me this last rule would help set it up to be different enough from the other Spirits because it would most likely contain high numbers of Sun Elements in its Innate Power Element thresholds. I was fascinated by the idea of having a Spirit whose final Innate Power Element threshold was something around the magnitude of 10 Sun Elements to trigger. A card that provided a Sun, Water, and Plant Symbol would instead generate 3 Sun Elements. You’ll see how this Special Rule fared in future articles.

So now that I had a basic idea of Special Rules and some ideas for Innate Powers, I went back to the thematic research and began crafting the Unique Power Cards. I took the same list and jotted down ideas for each thing:

* Oasis
   * Remove a blight
   * Gather Invaders
   * Gather Dahan
* Mirage
   * Fear
   * Gather Invaders
* Haboob/Sandstorm
   * Destroy Explorers
   * Destroy Towns
   * Fear
   * Push Explorers
   * Push Towns
   * Defend
   * Skip Actions
* Desert Heat
   * Deal damage with extra in Sands
* Cactus
   * Wilds tokens
   * Defend
* Desert Varnish
   * Defend
* Flash Floods
   * Ultimately decided against trying to describe this one since River had a Flash Flood card already.
* Quicksand
   * Defend
   * Wilds
   * Beasts
   * Destroy Explorers
   * Fear
* Singing Sand Dunes (Look it up, it’s pretty cool)
   * Gather Explorers
   * Fear

I did realize at a later date that Quicksand isn’t actually a desert thing (as portrayed in movies) since its composition requires a decent amount of water, which isn’t something that deserts are particularly rife with. Hindsight is 20/20, so I decided to go with it at the beginning since it seemed so versatile.

I’m a Computer Scientist by trade and I find that naming things is incredibly difficult sometimes. As such, I waffled all over the place trying to come up with a name for this Spirit. I really wanted it to have a name like Shifting Sands Consume the Lost, or Shifting Sands Devours the Doomed, but the alliterations were killing me. I threw around other weird names like Shifting Sand’s Black Blizzard, or even Desert As An All Consuming Void (blech). It was really hard. Then I finally settled on **Shifting Desert’s Gaping Maw**. It just felt right saying it and reading it on paper, so that’s what I went with. The name has grown on me since then and I don’t think I’ll change it.

Now with a name and some basic ideas of thematic elements I could use to bring the Spirit to life, I moved on to the next step, creating the first (very rough) draft.

Initial Ideas Chosen for Unique Power Cards:

* Bottomless Pits of Quicksand
   * 3 Cost, Fast, Range 1 from Sand, Any land
   * Defend 4
   * Destroy 1 Explorer
   * Add 1 Wilds
   * Elements: Water/Earth (Water = Sun)
* Scorch with Desert Heat
   * 2 Cost, Slow, Range 1 from Sand, Any land
   * 1 Damage
   * \+1 Damage if target land is Sand
   * Elements: Sun/Fire/Air
* Singing Dunes of Sand
   * 2 Cost, Slow, Range 1 from Sand, Any land
   * 2 Fear
   * Gather up to 2 Explorers
   * Elements: Earth/Sun
* Thrashing Walls of Sand
   * 2 Cost, Slow, Range 1 from Sand, Any land
   * Destroy 1 Explorer and 1 Town
   * Elements: Air/Sun

NOTE: Anyone who plays the game regularly will most likely find some things wrong with the above Power Cards just with a cursory glance.

Again, all names are WIP and most of them aren't even what I'm using now, it just goes to show how dynamic and changing the process was for me at the beginning.

This article will be limited to the draft of the Power Cards and some links on how to get your own templates to use for your own purposes.

Here's the [Power Card Template](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/180640/power-card-front-template-file) that I used as well as the [Spirit Panel Template](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/180025/spirit-panel-play-side-template-file). A huge shout out to BGG user Latzko and his amazing work in making these templates (as well as the others users that have contributed to the process).

Note: The files are in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic) format, so open it with whatever preferred software you have for it (Photoshop or something else). I downloaded Inkscape (and it's what was recommended in Latzko's post) and it has been a useful tool if you're not opposed to free open source applications.

The Power Card Template is pretty straightforward, you just need to download it and you're good to start using it after unzipping it from the archive. Just open it in Inkscape (or other program) and you can start working on it. A note, you will want to install the fonts that come in the zip archive to get what seems to be the closest font to what is officially used.

The Spirit Panel Template's directions aren't quite as obvious. I'll list out what each file is for and the format:

* Part 1 - Zip Archive that contains the SVG file, a README to help with explaining, and 4 font archives.
* Part 2 - It's a 002 Format, which isn't anything your computer will recognize. Just put it in the same place as the SVG file from Part 1
* Part 3 - It's a 003 Format, so do the same thing.
* Part 4 - It's a 004 Format, so do the same thing once more.

After that, with everything in the same folder, you're good to just open the SVG file in Inkscape and go from there. Latzko has provided a wonderful tutorial on the different aspects on the template and how to use it if you have questions.

So with that, I had made the (very) rough draft of the starting Unique Power Cards. In the next article I'll walk you through the process of creating the Spirit Board, including Growth option, Presence Tracks, Elemental thresholds, Innate Powers, and the reasoning behind all of it. Depending on how long that article is, I may even go into the first play-testing session where I learned that I new very little about balance.

Until then, see you all next time.",0.072,0.835,0.093,0.8764,55.2132

A story on how not to teach Imperial Settlers, or any damn game.",10,"This is a story of a game night I joined that is part rant but also advice for us here that *love* boardgames and find ourselves in a charged state while teaching others the wonders of our favorite games.

---

So I joined a different gaming group for the first time. There were about 8 people chatting and waiting for 7 PM to roll around. This group meets for range of game types. Walking in I saw games like **Imperial**, **Imperial Settlers**, **Sushi Go Party**, **Manhattan Project**, **Chinatown**, **Power Grid**, and **Endeavor**.

I have always wanted to try **Imperial Settlers**, so I joined with a girl, *J*, who has also never played and I believe the owner of the copy...let's call him *El*. So El breaks out all components and is explaining the empires, the expansions present, and which ones he recommended we start with. Cool. I don't know the game so I'm not picky about my empire. J got Barbarians, I got Egypt (not exactly for beginners) and he chose Japan.

We begin the teach. It isn't very organized and he is explaining *how* to play the game at a pretty brisk pace. Swords and stones and wood and razing and foundations and deals and actions and production...*UGH*. A few minutes in I ask, ""So what are we going for here?,"" asking really for our **purpose**. He stops, looks at me with impatient confusion and says, ""You're trying to get points. You're trying to get the most VP.""

""Well yeah,"" I reply. ""I see we are going for VP. I mean what is our purpose here? What are we trying to do?""

""You're trying to build a empire by building structures with resources that give you bonuses throughout the game,"" he forces out.

""Oohhhh!"" J and I let out in unison. The swords and stones and foundations all made much more sense! We continue on with the teach following along with considerable more ease.

It's time to complete setup. El's hands are sweeping across the table, grabbing our starting resources and placing them on our boards. J and I being new, we weren't quite sure why we got different starting resources. It had to be explained to us again. OK moving on. J is first player, chosen by that pretty neat app on El's phone that detects everyone's finger pressed on the screen and randomly chooses FP. 

Time to draft cards (the *Lookout Phase*). El lays out the four (3P+1) cards in front of us. Before J, the first player, can absorb what has been placed in front of her, El calls out the optimal card and suggests she takes that one. She pauses to read the other cards, but ends up choosing El's suggestion. El shifts the cards to me and calls out the next optimal card. ""You should take this one,"" and explains why it is the best option. El's brusque disposition was really starting to show here, most surely elevated from his fiery ardor for boardgames.

""Hold on a second, man. Let me see what's going on here,"" I leveled. I wanted to read these damn cards and learn what types of options we would be presented with during the game. As a learner, it's important to learn what is out there as much as it is to identify ""optimal"" cards. We draft cards in the opposite order, again experiencing El's declarations of the best cards for us before we could read and understand any of the cards placed in front of us. OK, here we go. Let's just play this game and have a good time.

The game gets going. Not long into it, I notice another antic of El's. His lower jaw is down and jutting out, chest rising and falling as air rushed into and out of his mouth, eyes piercing his cards as he studies them. The only thing missing was a caption hanging below his head: *[Heavy breathing intensifies]*. This dude *loves* this game. As J and I place cards down, El's eyes get locked on our cards as they are laid. He identifies the cards the instant he sees the front, and is again declaring to us what they mean, what we get, even which side to place the cards, and as I slide the card into place, all my resources earned have already been placed in my tableau.

The game goes on like this. El is moving our resources around, taking what we intend to spend and grabbing what we intend to take. His hands are in our tableau as much as he is spending in his. A few times I had to motion my hands in an attempt to slow him down and allow me to *think* through my own damn options. I didn't score as well as they did come game end. I owe part of that due to refusing to play his suggestions out of my own frustration from his intrusive ""facilitation"" of the game. I didn't have that great of a time and I likely will avoid his table from this point on.

So to my boardgame community I say, it's fine if your heart rate climbs when you hear that cardboard fart when opening up your favorite game. It is certainly a good thing to show the world all the awesome games it has never played. But fuck me, if you want them to have a good time and you want to ensure they know *how*--and want--to play the game next time around, get your damn hands off their tokens and game pieces, know when to bite your tongue and let them think--and act--for themselves (unless they are struggling or ask), and *let. them. fucking. play.*

Funny enough, I vented to my partner and he immediately reminded me of how he had to tell me in the past not to place my hands in any way on his side of the table due to pretty much the same reasons. So I am guilty too, but I'm more woke now following that game night. I will make every effort to allow newbies to a game their own physical and mental space for maximum enjoyment. Thanks for reading.

**Edit:** I'll acknowledge the personal element here and say that it isn't necessary for my testimony. I'll leave it in here for readers' reference but I will admit it wasn't necessary to convey my main message. I was trying to paint a picture, and I chose the wrong way to do it. El, you showed up in this thread. I apologize for the personal attack, but my message still stands. I don't think that should change now that you saw this post. Like I said, a lot of us are guilty in letting our excitement get the best of us, and it may become overbearing to others when we forget to slow down and let new players truly experience the game. I, particularly, enjoy the try-fail-experiment-succeed element of learning a game. I don't want to know the best move, I want to learn my way there. I think some here will identify with that. It just wasn't a good pairing of teacher-learner styles and thought I'd offer to the community, by example, a teaching style that is adverse to the learners' experience.",0.063,0.799,0.138,0.9987,9.987

What's yours?,19,"As I'm reading about Feld's latest game, [Revolution of 1828](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/265260/revolution-1828), I thought about ranking my favourite 10 games that he designed. His trademark games comprise multiple yet simple scoring systems ('point salads' to some), but the games revolve around mechanisms that limit the available options on any player's given turn. Therefore, players focus on action manipulation and managing flexibility. Anyway, here is my list. I know a few highly rated titles did not make it. Happy to see your list!

\#10. **Aquasphere** \- an interesting mix of rondel and delayed action selection. It's one of the more cutthroat Feld games as there is area control scoring and you can bump other players' pieces back to reduce their scoring opportunity.

\#9. **Macao** \- a simple yet brilliant design. Select coloured dice with pip value N, giving you N cubes of that colour N rounds from now. Any unused cubes on a round are lost. Would have been a higher place if the scoring is more exciting and the rulebook is better written.

\#8. **Carpe Diem -** the latest design on this list. The gameplay is simple, place a tile from a central market onto your board to earn bonuses and end game points for completed features. The round-to-round scoring is interesting: every round you must fulfil two adjacent scoring objectives on a randomised grid. Failing to do so results in losing points. It's a game about managing flexibility.  

\#7. **Notre Dame -** A card drafting game in which everyone starts with the same deck so you have a bit of control over what your neighbours can do. It's very smooth and the expansion added more variability.

\#6. **Bora Bora** \- a worker placement using dice. Higher number offers more powerful actions but a lower number blocks out a worker placement spot for any comparatively higher numbers. Very tight and sometimes brutal.

\#5. **Trajan -** Move cogs clockwise around a mancala and do the action corresponding to the final place you drop off a cog. It rewards planning ahead your next 5+ moves. Used to be higher on the list but perhaps I've played it too many times. 

\#4. **The Speicherstadt**  / Jorvik - The game of queuing. Queue up to buy a card, where the price equals the number of people in that queue.  Queue earlier for a better chance of getting what you want (sometimes at a steep price) and queue later to spite your opponents (or maybe end up get something cheap!). One of the most interactive Feld games and the length hits a sweet spot.

\#3. **Luna -** a perfect information game. This is about positioning your workers at the right place at the right time. A brilliant mix of short term tactics and long term strategy.

\#2. **Bruges -** a game of multi-use cards. Highly replayable especially with the expansion. Satisfying when you pull off combos or outwit your opponents on one of the majority scoring.

\#1. **Castles of Burgundy -** no surprises here. Very satisfactory to plan ahead and set off chain reactions.",0.072,0.77,0.158,0.994,18.886

Okay bear with me. I've only played it once and it was several months ago so my details are fuzzy and possible not entirely accurate.

&amp;#x200B;

I played it in February of this year (2019) and I'm going to say it was likely fairly recently released but don't bank on that, it could be years old, I'm not sure.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, all the details below are the best I can remember but may not be accurate at all so if you come up with a game that matches most things but not at all with a detail or two, post it because I may be wrong.

* It's a big board with several different areas/actions to do.
* I believe it's maybe ancient or medieval time themed.
* I think??? there's also a ship off the board where you can send stuff off for points or currency.
* You get 2 actions per turn and other players cannot do the same actions you do. (maybe 2 people can do each action? maybe a worker placement, but I don't think so).
* The middle of the board play area/action is steps you have to climb (2D, so really just move forward on) and you're trying to make it to the top each round to like maybe pay respect to the emperor/king so you can score each round. This part is very important because everyone each round has to make it to a certain point in this area or they don't get points or something bad happens.
* In one of the corners (bottom right?) there's a windy track players move along and this track is used for tie breaking during the game. There are many times where tie breaking is needed and the person furthest along on this track wins the ties. There are 2 checkpoints on this track (green gems) and you move forward and backward because you use something.
* Green(??) gems are like rare or important or something (I don't think there are other color gems, just this one gem).
* In another area you can hire people/abilities which are represented by small square (maybe 1in x 1in) cardboard. One of the people/abilities gives you a permanent discount for the game, 1 gives you more points, etc... You can hire multiple people / get multiple special things but I think there were only 2 of each special thing so there was a bit of a race to get these. They were pretty expensive though so you had to build up some kind of currency a bit first.

I think that's about all I have. I brought this up at game night last night and nobody could think of it  (thanks to my terrible recollection) so I don't have high hopes but figured I'd try here.

&amp;#x200B;

As tabletop gaming has started to gain newfound traction, with fans flocking to Kickstarter to express their support, the want for ‘more stuff’ is increasing in demand. Gloomhaven, for example, rose to the highest rank of BoardGameGeek by fulfilling the promise of a dungeon-crawling campaign that could take literally years to complete.

Smaller, bitesize cardboard experiences may not be quite as complex or immersive as their expansive big-boy-box counterparts, but there are some that manage to be incredibly rewarding, without requiring you to sacrifice an entire evening for the pleasure.

In the first of this series of collated board game micro-reviews, I want to look at a few games both big and small that attempt to strike a delicate balance between content and engagement, for those who want to be as efficient as possible with their tabletop time.

&amp;#x200B;

**BIG - Star Wars: Rebellion**

Never trust a board game by its suggested playtime. I have failed to heed my own advice too many times when bringing this game to the table. 2-4 hours seems like all the time this cat-and-mouse race through space should need, what could possibly go wrong? 

One player or team of two takes command of the massively overpowered Empire, attempting to locate and blow up the Rebel Base, controlled by the Rebels, who are simply trying to survive. There’s a set amount of rounds in the game, which the Rebels can reduce by completing special objectives, but there’s such a variety of cool-sounding things to do every round that it can take an exceedingly long time to plan and execute. 

While the thinking-phase of the game can vary in length depending on player experience, the combat is a persistent drag. Despite being logistically simple, the sheer amount of fiddliness with tokens and identifying damage done based on the colour of the die rolled means that it frequently brings the game to a grinding halt. That said, the asymmetric design of the game is relatively flawless: the Rebels have weaker forces but are able to constantly undermine the Empire, who struggle to pin them down despite their strength in numbers. This tension aptly matches the tone of the conflict in the Star Wars universe.

Verdict: Rebellion is relatively easy to pick up and play, but the brainpower required to outwit your opponent can too often result in epics that take longer to resolve than a trilogy of films. For everything there is to love about the vast majority of the experience, it can’t help but feel like a slog by the end. The combat definitely doesn’t help.

&amp;#x200B;

**SMALL - Love Letter**

Like the early seasons of Game of Thrones, this isn’t about thrilling battles, epic dragons, and illogical plot developments - this is about sordid romantic conspiracies and tactical masterminds deceiving their allies to distract from what’s hidden up their sleeve.

As a player you attempt to unveil and eliminate all other possible suitors of a princess until one lover is left standing, or by ending a round with the closest connection to the princess (a.k.a holding the highest number card). You only have two cards available to use on your turn, each with a number value and a special effect that can either help or hinder.

The challenge of this game is avoiding letting others learn the contents of your hand, as that is the easiest way to secure a rival’s elimination. There are no opportunities for temporary allegiances, meaning no one can be trusted at any time. Instead, this game allows you to expose how your friends behave when smuggling the truth under pressure.

Verdict: This game has been tough to recommend to friends, despite it’s 5-15 minute playtime, because the rules don’t seem as easy as other compact experiences. But whenever I can convince a group to give it a go, it’s great for testing your mates’ poker faces, and fun for anyone who enjoys some simple sexy subterfuge.

&amp;#x200B;

**BIG - Gloomhaven**

This is a mammoth game that succeeds at taking players on a sprawling campaign featuring a unique and engaging selection of playable classes, varied yet easy-to-learn mechanics, and inventive ways of repurposing a vast core set of components. There are so many boards, props, minions, etc, that the game can be a challenge to setup and initially organise, but these many different parts ensure that no two games are the same.

You are part of a Guild trying to survive in the city of Gloomhaven and the surrounding wilds. Over the course of 100 or so missions (with objectives such as ‘kill all monsters on the board’ or ‘escort the NPC from one corner of the board to another), players create and retire several characters as they follow a non-linear story in a world that gradually reveals itself. This is the closest thing to D’n’D in a box, without the need for a GM.

The overarching player/character development feels like a video game as you upgrade abilities, make moral choices, and find more loot, while the main gameplay is a cross between cooperative card gaming and strategic turn-based combat. This is all confined to scenarios that individually won’t take more than an hour or two to complete, without requiring much commitment from occasional players. The story isn’t going to win any awards, but it is satisfyingly fun context for any guild of adventurers.

Verdict: I have invested more time into this game than any other, with more than half of the content remaining locked to me. If you can find a way to ease the process of setup, this is a game that you will want to bring back to the table to continue your adventures, with a flexibility of playtime that can last an entire day or just a couple of hours.

&amp;#x200B;

**SMALL - Exploding Kittens**

Another Kickstarter success story, this game is about as brief as a game of Russian Roulette, and just as intense... well, almost. Exploding Kittens is about luck, screwing other people over, and avoiding the ever-present threat of sudden death by fiery feline.

In the Oatmeal’s tabletop debut, you either win or you die. On a turn, you play as many cards as you wish before ending your go by drawing a card. If that card happens to be an Exploding Kitten, you’re out of the game unless you have the means to defuse it.

A simple concept that carves out easy conflict between you and your competitors as everyone tries to avoid drawing cards, especially if all players suspect that a recently defused kitten might have been returned to the top of the deck by a near-‘sploded player.

Verdict: This is the preferred choice by most of my friends as the easiest game to get out for a quick game or several. It’s a refreshing outlet for friends to take turns at attacking one another while trying to turn the increasingly unlikely odds in their favour.

&amp;#x200B;

**BIG - Batman: Gotham City Chronicles**

This game and its jam-packed expansions can easily total a small fortune for anyone who wants to invest in the full collection. It’s incredibly immersive and wonderfully detailed for any DC fan, but that comes at the cost of time-consuming complexity. Surely this is the perfect case in point for my argument - that perhaps less is more and we need to refrain from buying into these deliciously complex collections of combat-ready figurines.

In a single game, one player takes the mantle of the villains, while the others each pick a hero and proceed to complete specific objectives. All of the characters and scenarios have their own features and contextual effects, to create an excessively detailed world for friends to showdown within. It really is a smorgasbord of delights for any dark knight fan.

Considering how many rules apply to the vast array of playable characters and scenarios available in the base game alone, it’s hard to say whether it would take longer to learn the game than the estimated 4 hours required to play a scenario. Not to mention that each playable character requires learning an relatively unique skill set prior to each game and, unlike Gloomhaven, these missions don’t contribute to a grander narrative.

Then again... this is the only streamlined Batman tabletop experience outside of the even more elaborate Batman Miniatures Game. For some, that alone might be worth it.

Verdict: I don’t know if I can recommend it. But I know that I want it.

&amp;#x200B;

**SMALL - Munchkin**

Munchkin offers a deluxe edition with a board that serves as a basic visual guide, but really this is a compact tabletop card game that proves you don’t need endless pieces of plastic for an adequate adventure with satisfying competition and character development.

Your goal is to reach level 10. To gain a level, you must defeat a monster. The game encourages strategy and conversation by giving you the option to work with or against each other. Players can either assist you in combat, in exchange for a share of the rewards, or they might side with the monsters to make life even harder for you

This game manages to maintain the depth of a classic dungeon crawler and strip out all the faff thanks to its reliance on a simple card-based system to create a variety of quick encounters and with rewards that progress your character. The experience is designed to give players a taste of what pen-and-paper RPGs consist of, in only a fraction of the time.

Verdict: A perfectly compact excerpt of what players desire from classic RPGs without unnecessary role-playing and fiddliness, which can be started and wrapped up within the same hour, or played on repeat for a satisfying full evening of dungeoneering.

&amp;#x200B;

**IN CONCLUSION (the long and short of it)**

There are stark differences between long hefty tabletop experiences and their condensed counterparts, as well as the types of audiences they specifically appeal to. Games that last several hours are typically tests of endurance and brainpower, testing players logistical ability to evolve their strategies based on the way the opponent is developing. Despite the draw of these exhaustive games to experienced players, the games that stand the test of time and get brought back to the table are those that respect your time, allow you to improve your skills, and provide unique experiences with each new game.

Whereas the games that last several hours absolutely require that you are with a group of people that are equally as committed to playing as you are, shorter games are great for playing with people you want to know better, or want to gauge the interest of before proposing an 8 hour Twilight Imperium Campaign. The best of these will expose something about the deeper personalities of the people around you in a microcosm, with the real challenge being how you read other players rather than rebut their actions. They are often perfect ice breakers or time-fillers for social occasions with friends and strangers alike, rather than being the sole focus of an entire evening (or longer).

&amp;#x200B;

I spent the last few days reorganizing and straightening out the collection and wanted to share. I finally got almost everything horizontal and fitting about as well as it can. Even after a big cull a few months ago, there’s just barely enough room to hold it all. Don’t mind the décor. It’s basically Nerd Halloween here every day.

**How long have you been involved in the hobby?**

I learned about new wave board games with Power Grid in about 2005, but didn’t really start collecting until 2011. Back then I’d go to three or four regular games nights a week. Lately, as the groups have gotten older and more dispersed, I’ve had to start hosting my own once or twice a month.

**What would you change about your collection if you could?**

I’ve reached the point where any game coming in will probably cause another one to leave. As you can see, there’s room for maybe 6 more. I wish I had a dedicated game room so people wouldn’t have to try to fit in the teeny dining room and bits of the living room.

**Prized possession?**

The Glory To Rome black box would hurt the most to lose. I almost did once. My car was stolen with a box of games in the trunk. Back then the Amazon price for Glory was about $150 and my insurance paid that amount. By some miracle, the car was found about three months later and the games were still in the trunk. I got the game back and got to keep the money. It also had Cash n' Guns in there when it was going for $200.

**What games might be leaving your collection soon?**

Definitely Sentinels of the Multiverse. I backed a couple of their Kickstarters because I love the idea of the game, but in practice I just don’t ever get it to the table. Probably some others, too, but I’ll have to think about it.

**Not Pictured?**

There’s Bargain Quest and Artemis Project coming in. They’re the first I’ve Kickstarted in a couple years and I’m looking forward to them. Behind the couch there’s games I’ll probably not play, but don’t want to get rid of like my childhood Star Wars Monopoly, some Harry Potter games.

I was reading the new meeple like us teardown when I noticed there's a new thing on their site.  It's a link to a [code of conduct](https://meeplelikeus.co.uk/code-of-ethics-1-0/). It goes over everything that the site promises to its readers and it's brilliant.   

I think it's new but it got me thinking.   There's been a lot of argument about ethics recently.  The guy from paradise posted a video saying it's okay to take money for reviews.   Watch it played did a different thing about paid reviews.    Men versus meeple seem to come up a lot.   They all do things in different ways and you need to really do your homework to find out what any of them think is okay and isn't.

So why aren't more sites just telling us how they work?

Whenever people talk about this a lot of people say ""as long as I know what's going on, I don't care"".   I don't know though how most sites actually work.   They don't make it easy to find out.   Lots get really offended if you even ask.

So why don't more sites just tell us what they think is okay and isn't?  It seems like such an easy solution.   If more sites did something like this it would be a good step towards at least a bit of transparency.  They can lie ofc but at least we'd know what they were lying about.

396,t3_c7o7sd,Impressions of Long Live The Queen from LudiCreations and Japan,7,"In recent years there has been a real interest in Japanese games. A number have been brought to the market in English editions, and that what has happened here with [**Long Live the Queen**](http://ludicreations.com/product/long-live-queen-classic-edition/). This clever two player game was originally published in Japan by Circle3D6. With the help of LudiCreations, it was finally brought to a wider audience with the help of a crowd-funded project that produced two editions: one that retained the Japanese art and theme, and a second version that used the diesel-punk theme of another LudiCreations game. There were other component changes as well, including larger tiles, a revised graphic design, plus expanded rules and some other new components that would help with the game-play. The result was a clever two-player game with a choice of two fine editions.  I opted to get the version with the Japanese styled art, so that's what I'll primarily be describing, but the game-play is identical with the diesel-punk version.

**Overview**

In Long Live the Queen, two players go head-to-head in a tactical game where they each play one of the queen's two daughters. Now that the queen has died, we must seek to persuade the members of the court to support our quest to become the new queen. To do that, we need to cleverly make use of our court personnel.  Both players have a line of 11 face-down characters opposite each other, corresponding to the possible outcomes of rolling two standard dice. The dice then activate the characters: those corresponding to the rolled number are flipped face up, or their abilities trigger.  

There are two different ways to win, either by being the first to get three of each prestige token, or by eliminating the opponent's princess.  Triggering the special abilities of our characters will get us the prestige we need in three main areas: might (red), wealth (yellow), and wisdom (blue). Alternatively, using our Assassin or Sniper on our competitor princess will also gain us victory. These two paths to victory are reasonably balanced, with a prestige win being more common, but your strategy will also depend on how your opponent plays.  In the inevitable tactical battle and see-saw struggle that will follow, will our princess come out on top, and become the next queen?

**Impressions**

LudiCreations have done an excellent job of bringing Long Live the Queen to English speaking audiences, and to a wider market. While coming up with a new theme and artwork, they have made the sensible choice of preserving the original anime style artwork as well, so that consumers can make their own choice about which they prefer. Certainly the components are excellent, with sturdy cardboard tiles and attractive dice being part of the package, along with wonderful artwork that I can't praise highly enough.

As for the game-play, it's a fine two player game which does exactly what it sets out to do, which is serve as a fast and highly tactical filler game with a light feel. Granted, it won't be everyone's cup of tea, and the amount of luck was the major reason why some didn't enjoy the game. Granted, the dice do play a significant role in determining the outcome - but that's to be expected in most games involving dice. But that doesn't mean that there are no meaningful decisions. The choices that you make, especially in how you arrange your characters, are still very important, and more often than not will determine the winner.

Each turn you also have opportunity to switch two of your adjacent tiles, or substitute which will be your ""Master"" ability that determines what your two ""Apprentice"" tiles do. So the overall positional set-up you opt for at the start of your game, and how you manipulate it during the game, is critical. The location of your Guard - which can protect your princess - is also very important. Two other very important tiles are the Assassin and Sniper, since these can take your opponent's characters out of action. Alternatively, you can focus on an income generating strategy that revolves around earning prestige chips before your opponent does. Whatever your strategy, it's certainly not purely random, because how your characters relate positionally with respect to each other and to your opponent will often prove decisive, even though you will still need to roll the right numbers.

Some players reported that the game dragged, and our first game felt like this a little too. But once you're familiar with the characters and their respective abilities, the game moves along quite nicely, and the length feels about right given how light the game actually is. Just try not to take too long about which characters to move at the end of your turn. You still need luck to be on your side to win, but clever play will make a difference. And given how quick the game can play, having the outcome influenced by luck is quite acceptable.

**Recommendation**

In the end, Long Live the  Queen will especially please those looking for a light two player game, and who enjoy a sharply tactical and positional game with some secret information that gives scope for bluffing, while at the same time allowing a generous amount of luck courtesy of the dice. Imagine combining the positional feel of Chess, with the tactical bluffing of Stratego, and the dice rolling of Catan. Now wrap it all up into a gorgeous package with unique artwork, and give it the feel and length of a filler. That's effectively what you get with Long Live the Queen. I for one am very pleased that LudiCreations has helped bring this fun and fast two-player game out of Japan, and shared it with the rest of the world.

Recently, I came across a local board game designer/distributor at a shop who was demo'ing his newest board game which, as a self-proclaimed board game enthusiast, I found quite enjoyable. Fast forward to many dollars spent and some limited communications, I was fairly inspired to start my own venture into making board games as a hobby (a very, very new hobby.) And as such decided to prevail upon the one person I knew who did this as a hobby for advice and perhaps a small amount of guidance.

I was surprised and somewhat disheartened to learn that he felt it a miracle whenever he sold a game. I understand that he is a small time, mostly self published, designer but he does work with many local game stores for the releases of his games and also has done a number of Kickstarters. My major question, and worry as a newly declared designer, is this;

Are board game enthusiasts willing to give the little guys a shot?

I know in my own life that I am an impulse buyer, which is the biggest reason I bought the initial game. But I was pleased by my further purchases, they weren't all winners of my preferences, but still worth a play. But what would need to be done, in your eyes, to increase the chances of buying the non-brand game over a big brand game?

I hope this doesn't feel like an attack on enthusiasts, I'm merely looking to help increase my own chances of success in the industry as well as gain some insight into what sets games apart to players. Also, sorry for the long post.",0.077,0.72,0.203,0.9915,23.796

Version 2 is forthcoming, with tape on the back to reduce burn marks and a better stain (non-oil based stain) that won't wreck the inside of the box. 

Tape was also added to the box because the boxes add weight. 

And I also tried using acrylic for the spacer, and I like how it turned out.

&amp;#x200B;

It was turn-based. We had four players but I think you can do 3-6. Each player started with a hand of cards, maybe 5 or 6. There was a mat/board where cards could be discarded/staged. I believe the object of the game was to run out of cards, but I might be wrong. It had a medieval/magic/pastoral type theme. Different cards had different values/abilities and could affect the other players, like causing them to lose a turn or pick up additional cards from the deck, kind of like UNO, but it was more strategic than that.  There wasn't combat per se, but I seem to recall that certain character cards had advantages over others in certain scenarios.

&amp;#x200B;

I would describe it as a cross between Risk and UNO, with some Magic thrown in for good measure.

&amp;#x200B;

Any idea what I'm talking about? If I had to guess, this game came out in the last 10-15 years. I have looked all over Amazon and my local game store.  Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I remembered some more details about the gameplay. At the beginning of each player's turn, you get to decide what card(s) to use, I don't recall any dice but there is an element where each card has a certain value (say 3 or 5) and you can use up to a maximum value (say 10) on any turn with any combination of cards. Again, I think the object of the game is discard your entire hand.

EDIT! I'm pretty sure it's **Dominion**, but I'm not sure what edition.

Actually, I'm positive, it was Dominion. Thanks all for the help!

Some of them seem to be basically 6 suits with numbers from 0-15 (I'm guessing at the numbers), some have other symbols and/or words on them so basically you can mimic other games with the cards.

&amp;#x200B;

It looks like it would work best with simpler filler type games that has cards with certain numbers and colors... Tichu, Take That!, 6 Nimit, The Game, No Thanks!,  type games come to mind... some of them have other symbols to simulate die rolls, dominoes, all sorts of things... but some of those look a bit convoluted to me.

I'm sure there's other systems as well....

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my questions for those with experience with them:

&amp;#x200B;

Do you enjoy playing games with them?  Or does it ""feel"" like you're just playing a prototype? (Especially if you're having to proxy cards that don't just have numbers... like if you said, ""ok, every Knave card is a ""draw 2 cards card"")

If there's extra symbols on the card, does it become overwhelming or distracting?

&amp;#x200B;

Morally, do you feel it's ""wrong"" to get these if it's going to replace (possibly) buying other games?

&amp;#x200B;

Which is your favorite deck and why?  Is it the one that plays the most games, or the one with the cleanest looking cards?

&amp;#x200B;

It appears that many of these you can't buy... you have to go to various printing sources and have them printed... how hard is that process?   Are you happy with the results?

Are these things just good for travel, or do you play regularly with them?

Today's article will be a little shorter than normal to make up for the huge amount of content that will be included in the next one.

Now that I had a giant list of thematic elements and numbers to draw from, it became time to create the first draft of Shifting Desert’s Spirit Board

**Innate Powers**

It was obvious from the start that I wanted one Innate Power to be gathering and one to be devouring. So here was my first stab at the Innate Powers:

* The Ravenous Hunger Devours
   * Slow, Range 0, Sand only
   * Threshold #1: 1 Earth, 1 Air, 1 Sun
      * Deal 2 Damage.
   * Threshold #2: 3 Earth, 2 Air, 3 Sun
      * Instead, deal 4 Damage.
   * Threshold #3: 5 Earth, 3 Air, 4 Sun
      * Instead, deal 10 Damage.
* Mirage Leads to Certain Demise
   * Fast, Range 0, Sand only
   * Threshold #1: 3 Sun
      * Gather 1 Explorer.
   * Threshold #2: 6 Sun
      * Gather 1 Town.
   * Threshold #3: 1 Air
      * For each Air you may repeat the Power (different lands are ok)

Note: I was about to learn about the nuances of Gathering by making this Spirit.

**Presence Tracks**

I decided I wanted to mimic something similar to Vital Strength of the Earth with play style. This meant low Card Plays and high amounts of energy. This lends itself well to playing Major Powers later in the game. Since I still wanted to trigger the Innate Powers with relatively few Card Plays, I needed to add Elements to the Presence Tracks. This proved to be a lot more difficult than I had originally thought. This explains why all the Low Complexity Spirits don’t have Elements on their Presence Tracks, which is actually a hard rule set by the designers.

So here’s my first attempt at the layout of the Presence Tracks on the Spirit Panel:

* Energy Track:
   * 2 Sun 4 Sun 6 Air 8 9
* Card Plays Track:
   * 1 Earth 2 Earth/Reclaim-1 Air 3

**Growth Options**

Here’s what I came up with for the Growth options:

* Reclaim All, Gain a Power Card
* Add a Presence (R3), Gain a Power Card
* Add a Presence (R0), Gain 2 Energy and +2 more per Sun showing
   * Note: this could net a maximum of 6 Energy when all Sun symbols were showing.

In my mind, there were enough Elements to get the Innate Powers triggered assuming all 3 Card Plays had Earth Symbols on them and if there were any Plant or Water Elements on the cards, I should have plenty of Sun Elements to trigger the other Innate Power.

With that, the Spirit (rough draft) was complete. I put it all into effect on a template in Inkscape and printed it out, eager for my first game to see how I did.

**The First Play-Test**

We played a 2-player game of Difficulty 4 of Brandenburg-Prussia to see how it held up against a slightly harder version of the base game. My wife played River (she always randomizes which Spirit she plays unless we’re doing something insane like higher level England). As we played through the game and eventually won, I was furiously taking notes on the Spirit Panel of things that I noticed and things I wanted to experiment with and change.

Here’s a summary of what I learned from the first play-test:

**Special Rules:**

* Gathering when placing Presence as a Special Rule is definitely too powerful. It completely invalidates Build and Explore actions in their entirety with no cost to the player.
   * It could be interesting if it was only Gathering things like Dahan, Beasts, or other things.
* The Ravenous Hunger Devours (Innate Power #1) felt good, but wasn’t enough to deal with everything.
   * It was also too hard to trigger anything beyond the first threshold.
* Mirage Leads to Certain Demise (Innate Power #2) felt really good thematically, but was too powerful in practice. Most likely was because it was a fast Power. Slowing it down would help me understand how it should be balanced.
   * Repeating this power with 1 Air made the game trivial. If I wanted to Gather multiple Invaders, I was going to have to earn it.

**Presence Tracks:**

* Definitely needed to redo the Presence Tracks. The Elements came at strange times and didn’t make sense.
* It seemed like I was just trying to avoid repetition on the Tracks (i.e. 2 2 2 3 4 5) and opted to fill the “useless” spaces with Elements instead. It didn’t work out the way I had hoped.
* The Energy gain was too high and Energy was never an issue, even in the early stages (also a fault of the Growth options).

**Growth Options:**

* Gaining 2 per Sun Element showing was definitely too powerful.
   * Considered changing it to a passive gain 3 with another 1 per Sun instead.
   * Or removing that component of it entirely.

**Unique Power Cards:**

* Bottomless Pits of Quicksand
   * It felt weird to add Wilds, Destroy an Explorer, AND Defend 4. There were instances where I’d play the card just to put a Wild down. That didn’t feel good at all.
   * I did like having a defensive ability, but I think there is a better way to implement one.
* Scorch with Desert Heat
   * It felt like it should either Cost 1 Energy or be Fast
   * The rest of it felt good.
* Singing Dunes of Sand
   * I liked the thematic part of it, but Gathering 2 Explorers (even slow) was too powerful and essentially negated the Explore action (and therefore the subsequent Build and Ravage actions).
   * Doing all of that AND adding 2 Fear was definitely too much.
* Thrashing Walls of Sand
   * Again, this accompanied with everything else made it so that I only had to deal with Explorers and Towns. The Invaders couldn’t ever get a hold long enough to Build a City throughout the entirety of the game.

**General Thoughts:**

* Turns out Gathering as a Fast Power is really powerful. I gained a new respect for all Power Cards that Gather or Push fast. To be fair, Gathering multiple things even as a Slow Power is incredibly powerful as well.

So there you have it. The Spirit was definitely too powerful for its own good. I nixed the Special Rule about gathering after the first round. It was obvious that it was too powerful after the first time I did it.

You can learn a lot from a single play-test and anyone who has ever made a game will tell you that it takes dozens (perhaps even hundreds) of play-tests and iterations before you come up with a solid design.

Next time I’ll talk about some advice I read from the designers that really changed my outlook on things and how my entire mindset shifted as a result.

They've seen me play the game a couple of times previously and have noted that there seems to be a lot going on.

I have had my eye on this one for a while. I have played base **A Feast for Odin** around 10 times and I love it. It is in my top 5 games of all time. However, there are a few other games I have been looking at that I really would like to buy as well. **Through the Desert**, **Spirit Island**, **Kemet**, and **Cosmic Encounter**.


At the end of the day, only I have board game nights with friends about 2-3 times a month. I also play a lot of solo games and 2 player games with my wife. 

With my group we play more interactive games. We group recently played **Spheres of Influence: Struggle for Global Supremacy** and it was absolutely incredible. We will be playing that a lot in the coming months I think. Also **Imperial 2030** which one of the guys just bought. So I feel myself moving more in the direction of war games or area control games that have more player interaction. But with my wife, we play more euro games and 2-player solitaire type stuff.

I'm relatively new to the hobby but have found myself to be a big fan of Mac Gerdts. I have Concordia and Navegador and they are two of my favourite games. I find them to have fantastically smooth flow, interesting decisions without excessive complexity and elegant, interlocking mechanisms. In Concordia, I love the variable setup with the cities and available cards as well as the card play. Navegador has the wonderful market and rondel systems. Both have great use of scoring multipliers.

I'm wondering whether or not I will like Antike II. It seems to be the next most-recommended game by this designer apart from Imperial (/2030) which I'd rather avoid for a few reasons (don't like the theme, not a big fan of stock-ownership games or the idea of indirect control over countries).

Antike II seems to be quite a different beast in terms of its inherent direct conflict and race to fulfill victory conditions. The groups I play with tend to be more on the ""care bear"" side of things and prefer the passive conflict of euro games. I  worry about non-aggressive players getting ""shut-out"" of the game and having a bad time. I also wonder if, as an older game, despite the 2014 update, the mechanisms may feel a little dated and dry.

On the other hand, I'm hoping the game might have the smoothness and tight design of the other Mac Gerdts games I've tried.

Is this game still getting a lot of play for you? Does the combat avoid being too arbitrary or ""take-that""?  Is it possible to thrive with a non-combat strategy? Is the game too intimidating or un-fun for newbies? Does the game play OK at 3 (my most common player count) or does it really need the 5 recommended by BGG? Is there another Mac Gerdts game you'd recommend? Some of my other favourite games are Terra Mystica, Terraforming Mars, Tigris and Euphrates, Scythe, Caverna and Hansa Teutonica.

For example, my brother and sister and I were playing, my sister was far ahead on science and we needed to deny her green cards to catch up. I was holding 2 green cards and said to my brother (who I was passing to next), if I discard this green card will you discard the next one when I pass you this hand? 

Or in a new game I needed to play the last loom so my brother didn't starve us for future ages, but I also wanted to play a better card, so I asked my sister to play the loom when I passed to her if I didn't play a card that would negatively affect her. 

My brother is very against this type of gameplay and says that we shouldn't be allowed to reveal what's in our hands to each other and it's against the rules. I said to him that there's nothing in the rulebook that stops us from making deals with each other and as long as we can communicate, barter politics is fine.

435,t3_c86ubj,Why are 'bad' games the most popular?,0,"This has maybe been discussed already, but was something I was thinking about recently.

I've always assumed that crap games like Monopoly etc are most popular because they're most readily available, but I'm starting to think it's not that simple.

Of the 'hobby games', some of the most popular are also some of the most poorly designed - Betrayal at House on the Hill, Munchkin, Fluxx etc.

Some may argue these games have some merits, and they do, but I think it's easy to make the case that there are much better options.

It's also not the simplicity of games - Monopoly isn't actually that rules light, and there are a ton of very light party/filler hobby games that don't get nearly as much love as their 'bad' counterparts.

So if it's not simplicity or availability, why is it that so often the most loved games are the most poorly designed ones?",0.066,0.745,0.188,0.9758,0.0
436,t3_c7myzo,[COMC] My Collection After 2 Years,23,"They're usually more organized than this but here is my 2 year collection. Not pictured is 7 Wonders: Duel which is at a friend's house. Also not pictured is D&amp;D core books,10 Magic guild kit decks, tons of Star Wars: Destiny cards/dice, some Pokemon stuff and some more KeyForge stuff (I really like card games). And Fireball Island is on the way. As you can see, most of my collection falls in the light-medium range because that's mostly the audience I play with. I'll probably stop at 100 games and will definitely be adding some heavier hitters like Brass and Eclipse but for now keeping it on the lighter side.  


If I had to get rid of 10 games though they would probably be:  Last Night on Earth, Tiny Epic Western, Vault Wars, Ars Alchimia, Dude, Nyet!, Arkham Horror LCG, Valley of the Kings, Oceanos, and maybe Flick Em Up.  

&amp;#x200B;

LNOE because while I think the characters and mini's are really cool, there's just better zombie games out at this point so I'd probably swap it for Dead of Winter or Zombicide. Tiny Epic Western because the game doesn't really intrigue me that much and I haven't had the urge to play it more than a couple times. Vault Wars...still never played it so maybe I should before I get rid of it. Ars Alchimia was an impulse buy that I also haven't played but I like the manga style artwork. Dude is a one trick pony and I have better party games but this game is great to play with a table full of drunk people. Nyet! is a solid trick taking game and the art is great but I want a little bit more out of it, maybe I'll play it some more before selling. Arkham Horror LCG is a great game but I don't have anyone to play it with to make buying past the core box worth it and its just a lot of money to sink into one game, even if it is good. Valley of the Kings is a very unique deckbuilder but the art is just...bad. Oceanos is like baby 7 Wonders and its a solid drafting game but after 10 plays its not that interesting to me. Flick Em Up is a game that I think sounds great in theory and then in practice its kind of a mixed bag (this is the plastic one though so that could be why).

&amp;#x200B;

Recent games I'm really stoked on are Chronicles of Crime, Decrypto and Welcome To. What do you think of the games I want to get rid of? Agree? Or should I keep some? I'd love to hear your opinions because I feel like I haven't given some of those games a fair chance.

Some of my favorites are obviously Arkham Horror, as well as Clank, Legendary Encounters Alien, and Agricola.  I should also mention there are about 10 games that are at my local game store as we play them quite often there so I've left them there.  I also have a lot of small box games like Codenames, Space Hulk, Boss Monsters, and quite a few more that I'll have to find another place for.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently got Batman Gotham City Chronicles which is why I went through this process to redo my storing.  I was using those cheap bookcases you would pick up at Walmart but after one collapsed recently and then me realizing how many games I have with them just sitting in my living room, dining room, and wherever I could put them, I knew I needed to fix things up.  All said and done, it was about $400 total for all the shelves, hooks, and such to mount all these shelves and they are pretty darn sturdy (drilled into studs like they should be!).

459,t3_c7x9vg,The Board Game book my thoughts,12,"Yes, that one.

I've received my copy today and am pleasantly surprised at the presentation and love the concept of it. I'm almost done and already have a list of things I want to buy/review in the future but that's the thing, it feels more like  an upgraded Argos book (sales catalogue) at the moment rather than an essential piece of literature.

Personally, I would have preferred more substantial reviews of the games and longer interviews with some of the creators. In a lot of the pages where there is an interview you'll see a chunk of text plastered on the page quoting a sentence that you just read or are going to read which made no sense to me.

A lot of the games mentioned are ones released from years ago and a good part of the beginning section is about the history of tabletop gaming which is interesting but going forward I'm not too sure how they will produce more content that doesn't repeat what's already in this book. 

Overall, for the price (25 euros) it won't hurt your wallet and is nice to have but consider borrowing a copy from a friend to see if it's your cup of tea before committing because it's not an essential guide by any means, more of a hey my dentist has this in the waiting room kind of book.

I know it may sound as though I didn't like it but that's not necessarily true. I enjoyed it. The only thing is there are a lot of things they have done to make it truly great and I'm looking forward to fully breakdown and analyse it!

Hello! I'm cross-posting this from /r/HelpMeFind.  Hopefully that's okay.

I've worked with my brother to try and find a board game that he and I played as kids (we're both in our late 30's now), and are unable to find the exact title. Hopefully someone out there can help!

The game was sort of like Clue, where you're looking to uncover how a crime was committed. It wasn't really a board game (no game pieces), but had individual flash cards that were about 5in x 5in in size. On one side of each card was a picture of the crime scene, and then on the back side, I believe there was a description of the incident you were asked to solve for.

To reveal the answer to the case, there was an area that you could place a red lens over-top to revel the text hidden within (similar to the game Password).

If anyone has a thought as to what this might be, we would be very grateful. Thank you!

I have been in the hobby for about 2 years but I didn't go out of my way to purchase games until recently. I had a really good college friend who invited me and a couple other buds over to play quite regularly so I pretty much just mooched off him for games, such as Scythe, Secret Hitler, Pandemic. But, once we graduated college, we all moved across the state (Indiana) and made it difficult to continue meeting up, so I began to build up my own collection back in October 2018 to play with my roommate and other nearby friends who I introduced to board gaming!

If I would change one thing about my collection it would be to add some heavier games. I've built up a pretty solid collection of lighter/medium weight games but I really would like to take the next step. Feel free to recommend me something based off my collection to try out!

Favorite Game: Ghost Stories (I've beaten it 3 times out of the 10-12 times I've played, but it's just a blast and everyone I introduce it to loves it).

Newest Games: Decrypto and Century Spice Road (picked these up because they seemed to get really high reviews and I enjoyed the gameplay I saw of both.)

Kickstarter games that will be coming later this year (hopefully) is Carnival Zombie and Wavelength. 

I have played all these games at least once, I've always made an effort to play new games before returning to an older game I own. I don't really have a prized possession, probably Wingspan just because it's such a hot game and I'm really digging the theme.

The only game that may be leaving soon is Time Stories. I LOVED the Asylum case but honestly, The Marcy Case felt so dry and it wasn't as puzzly as I wanted. And after seeing all the backlash with Madame, I think I will just want for the 2nd implementation of the game.

One of the hobbies that I really enjoy since my injury is boardgames. I actually host a boardgame group at my home every Saturday, but I still feel like I can’t quite get my fill of the hobby. While I use Board Game Arena to successfully scratch my itch from time to time, I’m wondering if Steam is viable for someone like myself.

The only reason I question whether Steam is something I could benefit from is because I now use voice recognition software (Dragon NaturallySpeaking, to be specific) in order to operate my computer. It’s a wonderful bit of software that allows me to do many things, but using it to control a mouse can be one of its more tedious allowances. While I’d really like to play some of the boardgames on Steam, I don’t know how much “mouse work” (drag-and-drop is particularly problematic) games often involve. A little drag-and-drop isn’t an automatic dealbreaker, but it’s a lot easier for me when the bulk of the “mouse work” involves simply clicking on stuff more than anything else. It's also highly problematic when I have to use coordinated keyboard and mouse actions in concert with each other. That would immediately render any game moot.

So, with those issues in mind, how viable do you folks believe Steam to be for a dude like me? The games I’m looking to play include, but are not limited to: Talisman, Scythe, Viticulture, Xia, Lords of Waterdeep, Castles of Burgundy, Terraforming Mars and the forthcoming GloomHaven. And if there are other games that you believe to be something I could play (boardgames or not), feel free to recommend all the titles I should check out.

You all have been a wonderful resource for me with prior boardgame-related inquiries, and I’m hoping you can come through for me once again. Many thanks in advance for all your input and inside, I genuinely appreciate it.

Unfortunately, Saturday's gaming session has left me feeling pretty jaded.

What was supposed to be a whole day dedicated to gaming quickly devolved in to a complete drunken mess, with myself being the only sober person. Last minute additions to our group quickly derailed our session, game components were dropped all over the floor, rules were ignored and I was left trying to steer a group of seemingly disinterested people through a simple game of Camel Up, before calling it a day early and heading home.

I left feeling like the lame or ""uncool"" one for wanting to actually **do** the thing we had arranged in the first place, rather than just get drunk. All I wanted to do was pack the game up and head home, but I was stuck in the position of either being a party pooper and creating an awkward atmosphere, or biting my tongue and trying to rush the game to it's natural conclusion. I settled on the latter. It was a sad moment when the game ended a round early and the group barely noticed as I threw the components back in the box to get it off the table as quickly as possible.

Since then, I've completely lost my desire to play at all. I absolutely hated the feeling I had of trying to force a game on people, and I'd rather not risk it again. But I love playing board games.

Before I started playing board games, I mostly just played cards with my family. We had tried out Catan and Ticket to Ride like most people started with, but I really didn't enjoy those, so I never really gave board games a chance. A friend started up a game night group and on the first night I played One Night Ultimate Werewolf and 7 Wonders. I hated them... The next week, I was hooked on both (I got burned out on one night pretty quick though).

I started buying board games almost a year ago, and my first purchase was Ethnos. I wouldn't say it's my least favorite game, as I do still believe it's a pretty good game, but it's the only game in my collection that I just refuse to play nowadays, because it was played multiple times a week for months on end due to it being the only 6 player game I had at the moment that was simple.

I quickly got into heavier, more strategic, games and bought Concordia, which is tied for my favorite game along with Brass: Birmingham and A Feast for Odin. I've been absolutely hooked on high strategy games and went on a (foolish) spending spree and bought a bunch of games in a way too short span of time.

I wouldn't change much about my collection. I could live without Hyperborea, as it has only made it to the table once, but I got it for free from the B2G1 free target deal. I do however wish I had more quick, simple games that I could play with my parents. They love Azul and Splendor, but they sort of struggle with complex games.

Here's more or less what I shared with them in response  to their comments and criticisms on the piece, many of which were also  raised here.

Let  me start by noting that the contract I signed with Bloomberg prohibits  me from sharing any communications between myself and my editor  regarding what changes were made and why, though I’ll go into as much  detail as I can in this post. It also prohibits me from sharing, for a  certain period after publication, the original draft, which was  substantially different from the published story – though, again, I’ll  go into as much detail as I can on that.

That stipulated, here's what I have to say. This will not be brief, but it will be thorough.

My  bona fides: On the gaming side, I'm a lifelong nerd, learned D&amp;D in  1979, and was introduced to my first hobby board game, Cosmic  Encounter, in '91. I became a serous board game nerd in the past five or  so years. On the journalism side, I got my first reporting job in 1991  and have been employed full-time or freelance in the field since then.  I’ve been a reporter, editor, and managing editor.

The  genesis of the Bloomberg story is this: I had freelanced for them back  in 2012, and earlier this year an editor I'd worked with sent out a  request for pitches. I already had the idea of writing about luxury  board gaming accessories, so I sent that in to him and he accepted. The  assignment was for 1,000 words.

Over  the course of the next few weeks I interviewed several serious board  gamers (I didn’t single out “rich people,” as suggested, but  crowdsourced folks through BGG and my local FLGS game night), several  manufacturers of accessories, and researched hobby board gaming trends  and statistics. My initial submission was about 1,300 words. Over the  course of the next couple of weeks, my editor got back to me with  multiple requests for additional information and interviews, and the  final draft I submitted was some 3,000 words long.

What  I can tell you about that draft: It included more from my interview  with Chris Stagno, more background info about the growth of the hobby,  more from each interview with the business owners, and -- crucially --  the overall draft told a cohesive story.

A  lot of that didn't make it into the final cut, obviously. Why? Two  reasons. The first is that while there is technically no limit to space  on the internet, online news organizations that pay by the word do not  subscribe to this philosophy. And secondly, while I was writing from the  perspective of a gamer, the ultimate audience my editor was responsible  for is not gamers but businesspeople and folks with money, and he had  to make sure the article addressed them. (Props to Brodogmillionaire1  for hitting that nail on the head in his comment!)

The  cold fact is, this article wasn't for board gamers and the editor did  not tailor it to them as an audience. That’s the reason behind many of  the editing choices.

Take the headline.  Firstly, reporters do not generally get to write them. I suggested a  different one: ""Introducing the $4,500 board game night."" This fit the  narrative I had created, which talked about how it was possible (not  required, but possible) for avid gamers with enough income to spend a  whole lot of money to pimp their game night. When the editor responded  with the one you saw, I went to bat for my original headline. I didn't  get my way.

And then there's the ""if  you want to play and play it right"" line. Oy, vey! Trust me, that one  grates on me every bit as much as it does on you. My first draft said  something along the lines of ""But if you want to play it like a  hard-core board game hobbyist...,"" with a clear reference to ones with  disposable incomes; by the final draft, that was gone completely. When  the edit came back with the ""and play it right"" line, I suggested  switching to my first-draft phrasing – I even said to him something  like, ""You can play it right if you're sitting in the dirt"" -- but again  he was editing to suit his audience, and that's clearly an audience  that thinks ""doing it right"" means doing it in a way that flaunts your  cash flow.

My editor wasn't a board  gamer but he is an old D&amp;Der, which at least meant he was familiar  with the history of nerd gaming culture. But he also leaned a little  heavier on the D&amp;D angle than I would have liked -- the references  to playing in basements, pegging D&amp;D as the progenitor of modern  board games (the original draft talked about Catan's arrival in the U.S.  sparking the hobby here), etc. He felt that D&amp;D was well-known  enough among his audience to provide a touchstone for readers. I  disagreed with the way he implemented it but, again, reporters  (especially freelancers) generally don't have that much sway over final  content.

Reducing the draft from 3,000  to 1,600 published words also meant that all of the interviews were cut  pretty deeply. Again, I'm a narrative journalist, so every interview  section was a self-contained arc. The editor cut out all but what he  felt was the most relevant parts. In my comments I tried plugging some  stuff back in but, again, there he had a word count target. I'm  impressed he went as long as he did in the final version, given the  assignment was for 1,000 words.

I'll  close by reinforcing the fact that I would love -- LOVE -- to combine my  nerd and professional lives and become a go-to professional board games  journalist for mainstream outlets. But the caveat for board gamers will  always be that those outlets (especially niche outlets like Bloomberg)  are NOT aimed at board gamers as a core audience, and most likely what  gets published will not fully satisfy hobbyists. Believe me, if there  was a Nerd Monthly magazine out there paying professional rates for  articles that delved deeply into the hobby and issues surrounding it,  I'd be doing my damndest to write for every single issue. But there  isn't. The hobby-related publications out there either pay nothing or a  trifle -- and part of the reason is, to be frank, there's no demand.  Effectively no one in the hobby is clamoring to pay for professional  journalism content about board gaming, since there is a lot of semi-pro  and amateur content available for free.

I  hope this added perspective on the process my story went through  between the final draft and the published article is useful to y’all. I  knew when it came out that many of the edits wouldn’t sit well with a  lot of gamers. My hope is, though, that by getting an article about the  hobby into Bloomberg, it’s going to create more opportunities for  professional journalist/gamers like myself to do more reporting about it  and reach broader audiences, and ultimately grow the hobby as a result.

I’ll do my best to check in on [r/boardgames](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/)  every now and then so I can keep up with the community here, and answer  questions about this article (and, hopefully, others in the future).  I’m more often on Twitter (@CalligraphyGame, @EJFtweets) if you want to  contact me there. Thanks for taking the time to read this!

I've just taken up the hobby last month when my girlfriend and I bought **Jaipur** and I haven't been able to get enough. The past month I have consumed a ton of board gaming content through Watch It Played, BGG and this subreddit. 

None of my friends play board games (or really seem interested to, unfortunately), so I mostly play solo. Occasionally I'll get my girlfriend to play with me, but I don't want to have to rely on that to be able to play. 

I got **Terraforming Mars** on Saturday and have been hooked on that since. Just won my first solo game a few hours ago. I think I'll eventually buy at least one **Arkham Horror** expansion, but I want to explore some other games first.

I haven't played anything too heavy, but I think I'd be interested in **Mage Knight**, **Gloomhaven**, **Mansions of Madness** and the like, so that's what my eye is on next.

498,t3_c8l2x0,Impressions of That's Pretty Clever (Ganz schön clever) - The roll-and-write game finally grows up,16,"Ever since Yahtzee, and probably ever since dice existed and people could start drawing lines in the sand, roll-and-write games have been popular. Despite its popularity, Yahtzee often gets dismissed quite quickly by gamers looking for more decisions. Enter Qwixx, a dice game from 2012, which brought all players into the game - even when it wasn't your turn. It won a lot of awards, and helped bring back the roll-and-write game into the spotlight. But Qwixx was still a very light game, and that's where **That's Pretty Clever** (2018) comes in. Originally called **Ganz schön clever**, this game is clever. But it's also addictive, fast, and fun. And perhaps most importantly for gamers: it has depth.

**Game-play**

The game-play seems familiar at first - you're rolling dice, keeping some, and re-rolling. But what makes That's Pretty Clever especially interesting is that you'll enter the dice you roll into coloured areas, trying to set yourself up to score chains of points later in the game. And you need to think about the fact that any dice you don't use yourself have the potential to be used by other players. It's ever so addictive, and once you grok the game-play, you'll find yourself playing it over and over, in your quest to get the highest score. In fact, you'll like it that much, that you'll probably even play it on your own.

**Impressions**

That's Pretty Clever is an outstanding roll-and-write game, and deserves all the praise it has received. It won't be for everyone, because it's not the light and carefree filler that it first appears to be. So if you're expecting a simple Yahtzee style game, you'll be in for somewhat of a surprise. But this is exactly why it was nominated for the Kennerspiel des Jahres, and not the more family-friendly Spiel des Jahres award. The fun in this game lies in the combos, and you'll need to plan ahead to try to set these up, which involves some real crunchiness. There's still some luck, since it's a dice game after all, and this will at times frustrate you. But the game is engaging enough - especially once you start hitting some combos - to keep you come back to it, over and over!

Despite the absence of theme, the real appeal here is how it creates the feel of being an engine builder, while remaining a relatively simple dice game. You're doing much more than just pushing your luck, like in most roll-and-write dice games. Instead you're drafting dice in a way that is ... well ... clever! This may make it a little more meaty than what the average family or non-gamer is prepared to handle, but gamers will lap it up. Expect some tough decision making, which will prove especially rewarding as you start triggering chains of points. I wouldn't suggest playing with more than 3 players, due to the risk of down-time, but for 2-3 players it's just perfect. The solo option and app are fantastic as well.

**Recommendation**

Has the roll-and-write finally grown up? Unsurprisingly, That's Pretty Clever has been a huge hit ever since it came out in 2018, and has been nominated for some big awards, including the 2018 Kennerspiel des Jahre. It also went on to win the Golden Geek for 2018 Best Solo Board Game. And its continued success is guaranteed with a new edition now available from American publisher Stronghold Games.

Just when you thought that the roll-and-write category had exhausted its potential, something new like That's Pretty Clever (2018) shows up to surprise us. Along with its sequel Twice As Clever (2019), these are very welcome additions to the ranks of roll-and-move games, especially for gamers.

504,t3_c8762b,I played another 10 new games (to me) during Q2. Here's another 10 mini reviews.,389,"Hi, I'm back with another bunch of mini reviews, or opinions, of new games (to me) that I've played during the second quarter of 2019.  
Here's my post for Q1: https://old.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/b82p2a/ive_played_20_new_to_me_games_so_far_this_year/  
  
I've not been playing as much as I usually do, mostly because there's been other things to take care of, and I was also ill for almost 2 weeks. So I've only got perhaps a third of what I usually play during 3 months. So that's why I have limited plays of these new games.  
Like last time, it's only my opinions, not actually educated reviews :)  
    
**Castles of Caladale** (2017), (3 plays, 2x2p 1x3p)  
I saw a Rahdo run through of this some time ago that got me interested, and recently found it at my FLGS at half price so I picked it up. It was an ok filler, fast and at first nice that it was not very strict how you placed your tiles. But I played it 3 times in April and haven't thought about it once since then, and now the lack of strictness is what is making me not want to play it again. One of my friends really liked it though, so might keep it anyway. 4/10.  
  
**Wreck Raiders** (2019) (2 plays, 2x2p)  
I Kickstarted this so I'm biased, but I loved this. There were some great decisions to be made, choosing the dice, placing your diver, and what to collect. I've only played it twice, I've had it difficult to get people to play it, some say the theme doesn't speak to them and that it sounds like a children's game. It might be aimed at families, but it's really great. I would like to play it with more players, as you keep helping your opponent too much on your own turns with 2 players (the worker next to where you place your worker also gets a treasure). Need to play more, but it's at 8.5/10 right now.  
  
**Jaipur** (2009), (2 plays, 2x2p)  
I mostly got this to play with my gf, we needed a new fast 2 player game after I destroyed Star Realms for us by playing it on the app and became much better than her. While Jaipur is a great game, it's not a replacement for those times we used to play Star Realms, it doesn't do it for us. We tried it twice at least, and I can see what people like about it. We'll see if we play it again. 6/10.  
  
**The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-earth** (2019) (2 plays, 1x2p, 1x5p)  
I'm a big Mansions of Madness 2e fan, and when I heard that they would make a LotR game in the same fashion, I was super excited. Then came many of the reviews, and from what I saw, it was a mediocre game. Well, they were wrong! This fits perfect for me, my gf, and my gaming group, and I think this is a game that thrive on the right group to play with. The card mechanism instead of rolling dice is excellent, the app is great, the tiles are beautiful, and the minis are really nice. Can't say that it really feels like a LotR game though, it could be any fantasy world, and they probably should have gone for that, but hey, they made me buy it ;) And Fantasy Flight has finally learned to number their damn map tiles! In MoM2e it's always a pain in the ass to find ""Street corner 2"" which there's several of. So I've only played this twice, but we'll play it a lot during the coming months and I think it will grow on me more. It's not gonna replace MoM2e for me though, but it's nice with a different theme and shorter play time. 8/10.  
  
**The Palace of Mad King Ludwig** (1 play, 1x2p)  
I hoped to get to play this again before I wrote this but I wasn't able to, so my opinions of this game is limited. Castles of Mad King Ludwig is one of my favorite games, so I wanted this in my collection myself, but my friend bought it so I tried his copy instead. And I must say, this was really strange to play, it felt like a mix of CoMKL and Surburbia, but somehow they manage to make it... underwhelming. I was thinking all the time ""oh it's like Suburbia here, wow! Oh it's like CoMKL there, wow!"", and when the game finished I wasn't at all excited about it. They tried to do so much but perhaps did too much. The tile placement was a little bit interesting, but then the tiles were really busy and hard to see, and some of the colors and icons didn't match. It was a mess. I still want to play it again but with more players. But right now, 5/10.  
  
**Copenhagen** (2019), (2 plays, 1x2p, 1x3p)  
I live close to Copenhagen so this caught my attention, and I do like placing polyominoes, Patchwork is another favorite. And it felt a little bit like Patchwork (or similar) mixed with Ticket to Ride, but the special powers are what made this game different, and much better. I liked it, it was easy, fast and fun. The table presence was excellent too, and having the first to 12 points being the winner made the pace of the game really satisfying. I think I will play this a lot more during the year. 7/10.  
  
**Minecraft** (2019) (1 play, 1x3p)  
Tried the prototype of the upcoming Minecraft game. I'm not allowed to say anything about it, sorry. But I liked it more than I thought I would.  
  
**Herbaceous Sprouts** (2019) (1 play, 1x3p)  
I bought this because I thought the theme was really nice and Steve Finn always gets my attention, he does some really nice and cosy games. I liked my one play of this, it's a quite short game and each turn is fast so not much waiting. You still have interesting choices to make each turn and I can see me playing this more. For now, 6 or 7/10.  
  
**Let's Make a Bus Route** (2018) (1 play, 1x4p)  
Only played this once, but I'm almost ready to give it a 10. I dreamt about this when I went to bed, seriously. This is a draw and write game where you make a bus route in Kyoto, each turn you draw a card which tells you what you need to draw on the map, and the card means different for each player, and you write on the same map. It's really great! One player managed to draw himself into a corner, which means you're eliminated from the game, and that sucked, I hate excluding people. But I guess you have to pay attention, and it really isn't that long game anyway. For now, 9/10.  
  
**Ticket to Ride: Switzerland** (2007), (1 play, 1x2p)  
Another game I've only played once. Ok, so not technically a new game, but I log them separately in BGstats so I count it as new. Switzerland was a good map, I like these small maps for lower player count. The Nordic map is my favorite, and this was almost as good, it was interesting that the locomotive cards could only be used for tunnels, even if it was annoying at some points :) If I were to put a number on this, I would want to rate it within the world of TTR, and then I place it third. Nordic first, then Europe, the Switzerland. And then I'll give it a 7/10.  
  
That's it for the second quarter. Hope to get more games played during the summer.  
Here's some short updates on the games I played during Q1.  
**Just One**, played another 4 times and I like it even more. It's now 8/10 for me. Really the only party game I've liked this much.  
**Quacks of Quedlingburg**, another 2 plays, still think it's great, but my friend bought his own copy, so I don't get to play it as much as I'd like, but very proud to introduce him to a game he bought himself :) Still 8/10.  
**Space Base**, the game I've perhaps played the most since last post with 6 more plays. Love this game though I never win, it's so pleasing to almost always get something, even if it's not your turn. Finally got my gf to play it and she absolutely hated it, too much luck, so yeah I guess I won't play it as much as I hoped :P It's 8/10 for me now though.",0.055,0.7,0.245,0.9999,388.9611

From the campaign page:

**""To the Barricades (not shown)**

**You will be able to order To the Barricades in the Pledge Manager as an Add-on. It will be priced at $50 + Shipping &amp; Handling (approximately $15 for US backers). It will be identical to the previous Kickstarter Reward and will have all stretch goals in that Reward. We won't be able to ship them Expedited unless they're included in an Expedited Reward.""**

From the FAQ

**""Can I order To The Barricades?**

**Yes! If you already have the base game (Retail, Adventurer or Champion) and you missed To the Barricades! you'll be able to order it in the Pledge Manager. It will be $50 + Shipping &amp; Handling.""**

I had some reservations about backing the campaign based on the cost but got some good responses from AEG staff on BGG about ""To The Barricades"" and the it's value. Bases on those facts, and the fact that I could add it to my pledge, I backed the campaign.

Today I got my email to set up my pledge manager. I went on less than four hours after I received the email and when I went to add my To The Barricades, it said sold out. It said copies were limited and there MIGHT be more available later, in August, well after the widow for refunds. This does not seem right or fair to me and feels like bait and switch. Neither statement above from Kickstarter page suggest anything about any kind of limited supply.

It appears many others are unhappy about this, but am I overreacting in being supremely annoyed by this?  Is this a violation of any of Kickstarters rules?  I've reached out to AEG in a number of emails and am really hoping they can rectify this, but unless the decide to offer the add-on to those who want it I would be very hesitant to back AEG Kickstarters in the future.

510,t3_c8dai9,First Impression of Root (and what I think critics are missing),31,"So, with two playthroughs of Root under my belt (the first game will be a learning game, guaranteed), I feel like I can provide a little insight into some of the conflicting reviews of this game. 

First and foremost: this game is NOT for non-gamers, at least not for people who aren't excited about playing. The rules aren't incredibly difficult, but they add up, and keeping track of other players factions is near impossible for someone who isn't invested. This is actually where I think a few critics have gone wrong. This game is meant to be played as a light game for wargamers, or a heavy game for area control gamers. Yes, this game will be completed in 2 hours or less, but there is a lot of depth here that isn't immediately apparent. 

I must talk about my biggest flaw, or buying consideration, about this game after playing a couple times. Like SUSD said in their review, this game operates on the continuous balancing by players in terms of taking down the leader. There needs to be an understanding of who is winning and why, or else the game will never be satisfying. This leads to one reality I've discovered: you really have to play this game with the same people. I've played just twice, and if we were to swap one of the players in our group with a smart gamer who hadn't played, this player would be forced to trust us when we told them who was in the lead and why it was their responsibility to stop them. In something like Kemet, the VPs are easily trackable, and there's only a couple ways to get them. In Root, you have to track everyone else's game and ways of winning. It is so heavily asymmetrical, the burden of engagement is extremely high.

The thing is, I would not say this is to the detriment of the game. I appreciate a high buy in of engagement, and I won't knock a game for new players being disadvantaged. However, this all produces a very particular type of game flow and play experience:

Whether to it's detriment or not, Root is a game of constantly trying to score points while harming the leader, and the person who wins will often be the one who played an absolutely mediocre game until the very end. Sometimes, there are runaway leaders because people are too focused on their own factions (this will almost certainly happen in your first game). But more often, you will play a game of Root in which the winner never did anything ""crazy"" or ""awesome"". I know it's my first two plays, but from what I've read elsewhere online and what I've seen on YT playthroughs, my experience seems pretty consistent with others. Feel free to let me know if you disagree. 

My first impression of Root is actually positive, believe it or not. The production is the best I've ever seen at this price point, and the humdrum of managing your faction is actually quite fun and interesting, even if it's not highlighted by rushes of adrenaline or ""big-brain plays"". I've enjoyed my first two plays, and look forward to playing more. Moving forward, my biggest concern is the crunch of each individual faction. Could I play the same faction 10 times and have more fun each time, is there true depth to these factions? This is what I'll have to discover moving forward.

Please, let me know your impressions and thoughts of Root either early, or with many games under your belt.",0.059,0.739,0.202,0.9987,30.9597

I started playing table top games in Middle School mainly as a **Warhammer 40k** and **DnD 3rd Edition** fan but enjoyed basic games like **Risk** and **Monopoly**. The first game that showed me the breadth of the hobby was **Conquest of the Empire** which my friends and I would play and argue over at sleepovers into the wee hours of the morning. I have fond memories of these session even though the playthroughs were often disastrous due to disagreements over the rules. Around this time I bought **Smallworld**, **Catan**, **Ticket to Ride**.

Soon after I bought **Agricola** which showed me the strategic depth of Euro games and worker placement games. My collection grew quite a bit in this era and games like **Eclipse**, **Dominant Species**, **Through the Ages**, and **Terra Mystica** remain some of my favorites.

About half of my games have been bought since I got **Food Chain Magnate** a year and a half ago. Most of these games are either heavy strategy games or good 2p games for my girlfriend and I to play. As my pre-order list probably indicates, I love Splotter games. I've played **Food Chain Magnate** about 15 times and it is probably my favorite game currently. I quite enjoy **Antiquity** too though it plays much differently.

About 8 months ago I got bit by the **18xx** bug. I discovered these games reading about the favorite games of game designers on this subreddit. I bought the Lookout games edition of **1830** and have played it 6 or 7 times. Each games flows in a very unique way and strategy must be adapted accordingly, which is not true of most other games in my collection.

I also want to mention one of the most unique games in my collection, **Techno Bowl**. This game is simple at face value but the strategy goes very deep as I have learned in the Discord TTS Techno Bowl league I am in. Its my favorite game that includes in-game luck elements.

517,t3_c8ez17,What mechanics am I missing in my collection?,14,"I've been playing and collecting games since almost 10 years now. My collection isn't too big (50-60), but I usually get around to playing most of my games in a year, which is a feat in this hobby nowadays. I've been finding myself wanting to buy new games, but I'm also trying to by games with different mechanics than I already have so I'm not doubling up on the ""types"" of games I own. So, *I need some help deciding what games to look into next to ""fill in the gaps"" of missing mechanics or maybe even suggestions of what to replace in my collection if another game does the same thing/mechanic better.* Here's are is a general list of mechanics along with the games I own that fit into those categories:

*Action Points*: **Blood Rage**

*Action/Role Selection*: **Race for the Galaxy/Puerto Rico** \-- Is there another game that does this better that I might be missing out on?

*Area Control/Area Influence*: **Blood Rage, The Godfather: Corleone's Empire.** Any better ones?

*Asymmetrical/Variable Player Powers:* **Android: Netrunner, Scythe**

*Auction/Bidding:* **Power Grid** and some others have it as a smaller mechanic in the game. I think this is one I'm lacking in?

*Co-op:* **Pandemic** and **Eldritch Horror**

*Deduction:* **The Resistance**

*Drafting:* **7 Wonders, Sushi Go,** and others have it in smaller ways (**Blood Rage, Godfather**)

*Deck Building:* **Dominion** \-- This is one that I always get stuck on. I've been thinking about getting **Clank! In! Space!** just to have a Deck Builder that is...a little bit of something more? Are there other games that fit this bill? I guess *Bag Building* would be a similar concept, and I really don't have any of those. What are the best?

*Dexterity:* **Jungle Speed** is the only one I have, but it doesn't hit the table very often at all. Any suggestions here?

*Dice Rolling:* **Dice Forge** is the best fit from my collection with others that obviously have it as a smaller mechanic. What are your favorite games when you just want to chuck dice?

*Engine Building:* **Scythe** or **Puerto Rico** to some extent? What are your favorites for this category?

*Hidden Movement:* **Fury of Dracula** only happens every so often. Do you have others that hit more often for your group?

*Party:* **Codenames, Cash 'n Guns**

*Real Time:* **Captain Sonar** and **Space Alert** (although, my group didn't get into Space Alert all that much)

*Teams:* **Captain Sonar, Codenames** \-- not sure what other good ones are...

*Tile Placement:* **Carcassonne** and **Azul** (not sure if this one fits here)

*Worker Placement:* **Agricola, Lords of Waterdeep, Dinosaur Island**

Now onto a couple mechanics I know I'm missing....

520,t3_c8sutw,[Ultimate Werewolf] What are your rules on private conversations?,11,"I hosted a game the other day where someone mentioned they privately told someone their role.(told, not showed) They were the minion working for the werewolves.

This brought up the debate over if this type of chatter is allowed. I'd love to hear what everyone thinks. Here are my thoughts:

* In this example, the player was telling the truth. But this could have been a lie.

* They did not show their actual role card to the player. That would 100% be against the rules.

* This was a 9-player game, so it was relatively intimate. They slipped in the information during the chaos.

I feel like there is a good argument for and against this. Partly, I don't like encouraging side conversations. This takes away from the heart of the game. At the same time, the game is meant to be about manipulation and lying. Nothing is stopping a player from saying something that is a lie publicly.

I also feel like the size of the game warrants another opinion. In games of 40+ that I've been a part of, it's going to be impossible to maintain order and only hear a single player talk at once. Side conversations are much more likely at that point. It's very difficult to coordinate with all players at those larger numbers. In these cases, I think it would be more acceptable. Again, what you say may be a lie.

Would like to hear some thoughts, but I am leaning towards allowing this in future games. But I would like to encourage against it if the player count is small.",0.043,0.867,0.089,0.8851,9.7361

**Description from Boardgamegeek**:

Description from the publisher:

The T.I.M.E Agency protects humanity by preventing temporal faults and paradoxes from threatening the fabric of our universe. As temporal agents, you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.

T.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of ""decksploration"". Each player is free to give their character as deep a ""role"" as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it's also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.

At the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the number of players. Each attempt is called a ""run""; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players' disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario’s obstacles.

The base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which — Asylum — is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers.

You usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you'll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time...

In the box, an insert allows players to ""save"" the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game. This way, it's possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles, the remaining TU, the discovered clues, etc.

T.I.M.E Stories is a decksploring game in which each deck makes anything possible!

It uses cubes as building materials for a pyramid. Each cube has an icon and color, and is placed atop a cradle which allows you to construct a pyramid. Each turn players can pull one cube from the pyramid as long as at least 2 faces are exposed, and it's not directly touching a cobra cube. Each cube is worth 1, 2, or 3 points, but the 1 point cubes help you achieve majority for each color, which can give you bonus points at the end of the game.

It's a nice light game that has some interesting tactical choices. Do you shoot for higher point cubes, or aim to collect the low value cubes of one color to earn you a set bonus at the end.",0.04,0.793,0.167,0.9716,12.6308

527,t3_c8tjqv,Table of ultimate game box/order count,7,"Hi All,

  I ordered a table of ultimate gaming 4.6 elite (with a few accessories) in May and was told July delivery. 

  June 28th i came home from work and saw a big box at the end of my driveway.  I looked and noticed it was part of my table... very confused as many others have experienced, i had no notification of the table coming.  There was also a long box at the garage...

  After breaking my back carrying in the 80lb box, I noticed it said 2 of 2.  I emailed TOUG and so far no response as to whether or not i will get tracking numbers and how many boxes my ordered shipment will come in. 

  Since then i have received 2 more boxes on Monday and Tuesday. 

    I ordered:
       The 4.6 Elite Table
       Table Tops
       Table Mat (Black)
       PVC cover
       2x 2-Cup Holders (Free with code!)

   i ask those of who have received part or all of your table: How many boxes did the shipment come in? I have already received (as i said) box 2 of 2 for the table, the mat, the PVC cover and the table tops.  I am assuming there are 2 or 3 more boxes coming. Box 1 of 2 and either one or two boxes with the cup holders.

   I found the instructions and other people's posts that say 4 boxes... but i am wondering since i got the 2nd version, maybe they streamlined the packaging of the table proper into 2 boxes?

We have had our podcast for around six months now and have a decent amount of episodes up now (around 12) and we are looking for some feedback from the community so that we can continue to claim a small spot in the crowded board game podcast world. 

Our podcast is called Random Draw Podcast. We are three friends who play games every week and release our podcast twice a month. We are on the lighter side with little strategy and more humor and joking around while we discuss the games we played. 

We would love for you to give us some feedback so we can continue to improve and grow. Thank you all for your time with this.

Let’s be honest – there is too much happening in board games. There are too many games, too many podcasts, too many blogs. Just too much of everything!

This is a [modified repost](https://meeplelikeus.co.uk/meeple-monthly-roundup-july-2018/) (with mod permission) of an article that was originally posted on Meeple Like Us and it's aimed at raising the profile of all the great stuff out there you might have missed last year. I'm hoping to do one of these at the start(ish) of each month in 2019.  This post is from 2018.  It's a historical digest - an attempt to make sure great things don't fall into the memory hole.

There's also a [round up for the previous month](http://meeplelikeus.co.uk/meeple-monthly-roundup-june-2018/) if you want to catch up with what (was) great in tabletop coverage!  As in, what was great in 2018, which is last year.

I’m regularly blown away by how much work people put into their own reskinned version of their favourite games.  [This remake of Ethnos to fit the Moana theme though](https://imgur.com/a/hNItFN5)… not only is it a marvelous piece of work it is a very fitting tribute for an absolutely joyful theme.   I see what’s happening, yeah. We’re face to face with greatness and it’s strange.

* * *

Have you been keeping track of the Overturn Kickstarter drama?  If not, then [this writeup from the Australian Tabletop Gaming Network](http://atgn.com.au/overturn-rising-sands-kickstarter-caught-plagiarising-still-track-funded/) will get you all up to speed.  As long as the speed and aggression with which KS projects get funded remains a point of pride within this hobby, things like this are going to keep happening.   You’ll also get a lot of hot takes on the [Reddit thread on the controversy](http://atgn.com.au/overturn-rising-sands-kickstarter-caught-plagiarising-still-track-funded/).  Kickstarter eventually responded by suspending the project, and as you might imagine that provoked [its own thread of spirited discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8zxe1l/overturn_kickstarter_suspended/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=boardgames).

* * *

Given some of the things that we’ve discussed in the past with regards to paid previews/reviews of games it won’t come as any surprise that we were interested in [this reddit thread on the value of paid previews](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8whr11/heres_a_list_of_the_top_5_games_according_to/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=browse&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=boardgames).  The key question here is ‘value for whom?’  

A similar thread popped up on BGG and I’ll also [direct your attention that way](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2032372/sad-state-kickstarter-reviews-and-previews).

* * *

Conventions can be a tense time for people - they’re loud, busy and often stressful.  Many people love them and are energised by them. Some though find them intimidating and uncomfortable.   We’ve been through a rough patch regarding conventions but we have this [upbeat tale of a mother and her daughter visiting Dice Tower Con](http://www.meeplemountain.com/articles/a-mother-and-daughter-walk-into-dice-tower-con/) as a more hopeful take.

* * *

Teaching the rules of a game is one of the more constant challenges that face many of us that are enthusiasts for the hobby.   Before anyone gets to have fun they have to listen to a lecture like they walked into some kind of weird board-game classroom.  [Pawn and Pint put up an interesting video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb-CNylD90w&amp;feature=youtu.be) about how they approach the task and why they do it.  

* * *

There are lots of studies that show gaming has a positive impact on depression and other conditions.  Play Therapy is a real thing and has been a topic of vibrant study for years. I found [this reddit post on boardgaming and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8wzpic/boardgaming_is_helping_me_fight_depression/) to be a heartening read as a personal testimony.

* * *

Last month we pointed you to the work of Ertay over at the Sightless Fun blog as he worked to make Pandemic accessible.  Well, he’s [done it again with Secret Hitler](https://sightless.fun/Secret-Hitler-Board-Games-You-Can-Play-Blind/) and (obviously) I think you should head over there and check out what he’s been doing.

* * *

Being a cloistered academic with no real world skills, I’m often profoundly envious of people that actually make things.  I look at their hobby projects like a dog that’s been fooled by a fake thrown ball one too many times - some kind of trick must be involved, right?  But no, here’s an [awesome video of a game table](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WbmgpryC5k&amp;feature=youtu.be) being made right in front of you.  

* * *

It seems like Kickstarter games are engaged in a constant spiral of oneupsmanship, each trying to outdo each other in terms of the ridiculously lavish and over the top production values they offer backers.   That’s fine and all, although I’m increasingly concerned about the socioeconomic impact such indulgence has on the hobby. I think we can all agree though, I hope, [when your ‘miniatures’ are bigger than an actual baby](https://twitter.com/eric_lang/status/1015389267701436416) it’s time to take a moment and step back even if it’s just to change the language.  

* * *

One of my favourite discussions this week was on a Reddit thread that managed to end up with 146 comments and zero upvotes.   It was on the [Splotter series of games and how the author believes the finished products look like prototypes](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8wyo43/can_we_all_agree_that_splotters_despite_having/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=boardgames).  There’s a lot in here to consider including the views of those that like the graphic design, those that don’t, and those that take the topic off the rails into more philosophical areas of value, elitism and game design.

Have you at any point found yourself thinking ‘I wish I knew what BoardGameGeek’s community had collaboratively decided were the best games of each chronological year from 1968 onwards?’.   Admit it, you have - we all have. Well, you can have it Cinders! [Here’s a Reddit post that gives you that exact thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8whr11/heres_a_list_of_the_top_5_games_according_to/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=browse&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=boardgames).

Kevin Wilson appears relatively frequently in these roundups because his twitter threads are usually very good.  Here’s [another one on design bandwagons](https://twitter.com/KevinWilson42) and it’s well worth your attention if you’re at all interested in game design.

* * *

Another great Twitter thread is [this one from Actualol](https://twitter.com/actualol/status/1023709555769987072) on how Twitter itself makes him depressed and distressed on a daily basis.  There is so much of value in here. A lot of Twitter follows a cycle of ‘virtue [gazumping](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/gazump?s=t)’ that ends with everyone feeling sad, helpless and endlessly judged.   I think a lot of people on Twitter are well meaning, but also stuck in a dangerously naive echo chamber where mass agreement is easily mistaken for having a positive impact.  Anyway, that’s me editorialising but I think you should definitely check out and reflect upon what Actualol has to say.

* * *

Being aware of people with disabilities at a convention is hugely important - it’s already busy, crowded and stressful and carelessness can be a major impediment to people enjoying the experience.  [Hans Cummings has a great post up](https://vffpublishing.com/2018/07/19/take-care-be-aware-at-gen-con/), specifically about Gencon but applicable to any convention, that’s well worth reading to make sure you’re appreciative of the challenges people might be facing.

* * *

A new documentary about board game designers has been announced, coming from a partnership between [Zoom Out Media and BoardgGameGeek](http://thegamedesignersmovie.com).  The problem is, [as Katie Chironis points out](https://twitter.com/kchironis/status/1022191549658976256), that of the 28 designers they were originally featuring, not one was a woman.  It’s genuinely is a really poor showing in this day and age. When asked on Twitter about who should have been included, Katie also provided a link [to this excellent Reddit](https://t.co/nSAz8SCLWf) post that lists women designers and their associated BGG ranking.   At the time of writing, some women designers have been added to the lineup but it’s really not good enough that it takes a public backlash for a half-hearted stab at representation.

* * *

I have never played Tales from the Loop (RPGs are a difficult thing to fit around all the other obligations and barriers in my life) but I have been enchanted by its art, design and aesthetic.  So I’m really interested to see that Amazon are going to be making a [Tales from the Loop television series](https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/amazon-tales-from-the-loop-1202875431/). It’s kind of weird though - Tales from the Loop is kind of like ‘Stranger Things: The Game’ and now ‘Stranger Things: The Game’ is going to become ‘Stranger Things: The Game: The TV Show’.   I’ll be keen to see how it all manifests.

* * *

Rebecca Strang of [To Play is Human](https://toplayishuman.com) and Lauren Woolsey of the [CGS Unit](https://cgsunit.com) have teamed up to start a new podcast focused on inclusion and accessibility - it’s called the [Playability podcast](https://playability.fireside.fm/0) and you can [follow their Facebook page here](https://www.facebook.com/PlayabilityPod/)!   I couldn’t be happier to see more voices covering this important topic and we here at MLU wish them all the luck in the world.  We’ll be following along closely!

* * *

I saw a really interesting thread on Twitter - it’s from [Papa Shell](https://twitter.com/Papa_Shell) and it’s about the [real-life economics of TTRPG publishing](https://twitter.com/Papa_Shell/status/1021902196080893952).  It’s an enlightening read regarding just how little money there is in even what seems like a monster hit.

As always, one from the archives to finish up.  I was reading through some old [Cardboard Children](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/09/27/cardboard-children-goodbye/) columns the other day, because that’s just the kind of guy I am.   I made it all the way through to the earliest entry and thought ‘Well, that’s a good thing to put into the roundup for this month’. For those that don’t know, this was Robert Florence’s (mostly) weekly article for Rock Paper Shotgun on the topic of board-games.  I’ve made no secret in the past that I think Rab Florence is great, and I believe he’s one of the most undervalued talents in the hobby. He’s been at it a long time too, as this [column from September of 2010 shows](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2010/09/18/cardboard-children-dungeonquest/).   In **completely unrelated** news, you should all also keep checking out [Cast the Bones](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5wtuY_UIcHG6LguU5mlT4g) for the absolute best thing that is happening in board game video content.  Happening right now! I am going to keep plugging this thing until it gets the attention it deserves.

542,t3_c8mtja,A coop games discussion,15,"I had a discussion the other day, inspired by a coop game (Gen7) and I'd like to see what people think about it.

The discussion came from the game being increasingly complicated, and from situations arising where we needed to exactly plan out a round in detail before even taking the first action. A few times during this and previous sessions, I felt that the situation can get a bit too complicated, and in those cases we should put a threshold on how much we discuss, and accept that there may be less than optimal plays. Another player thought that we should dedicate a few more minutes to analyze the situation and reach a conclusion instead.

During the discussions, we focused on the following aspects of the issue. 

* I felt that some players, including me, get tired from the cognitive load of presenting and analyzing all options some times (especially when we discuss for a few minutes and then we realize that we forgot a parameter and the discussion needs to restart, etc.). The other player said that that's fine, in that case the players who are tired can step back and let the rest, who still enjoy it, figure out the situation and let them know what to do.
* I pointed out that being told what to do is taking away the joy of the game to an extent, since at that point it stops being a cooperative experience. It's the alpha player problem. The other player said that being forced to stop figuring out the optimal solution is also taking away the joy of the game, the whole point is to gather and figure out the solutions to the situations presented, together (those who want and can do it at each point). They also thought that another player who was in this situation was probably happy to step back and let the rest figure it out. 
* Note that during most of the game we all participate in the discussion and problem solving, it's only a few times when we reach the point where I think we're past the threshold, so take the sentences in the previous point to be about occasional times during play, and not the entirety of it.
* The other player also said that if the majority of the people around the table feel like I do, and don't want to step back, then the other player would agree to stop analyzing and get on with the game, but they feel it's not that much of a problem for anyone who gets tired to step back for a few minutes, since otherwise their own reason to play gets taken away involuntarily.

To me it seems that the above ways to look at this situation are at odds and can't be fully reconciled. Of course, depending on how pronounced they are in the game, they can be overcome by small compromise, perhaps.

During my search I stumbled upon Gloomhaven and Middara. I had the chance to playtest a short round of Gloomhaven at Spiel in Essen and it was quite cool.

But I am uncertain if Gloomhaven would fit to us. 

This week I looked at Middara KS and it seems to inclued more rolleplaying elements regarding customization and individuality. The artwork was pretty amazing and the miniatures are cool.

So are there any people who have played both and can answear some questions I have?

1: Replayabity? I know that you use stamps or stickers in GH to mark special points on the map, does it make it less fun to play it again? In Middara you have different endings depending on your choices and the Skills you can take, make a different character.

2: Complexity? Due to the amount of individual character builds, are the rules in Middara more complex and harder to learn than in GH? Some of our players have a short memory and I hate to explain rules over and over again. 

3: Story? Is the Story in Middara influenced by the manga style? Is it more ""adult"" like Berserk or something like that? It looks pretty ""childish"" from the artwork sometimes. How is the story of GH compared to that?

4: Solo or Two player? I know that you can play both games alone, but how much fun is that? I read that GH can be pretty complex when playing alone. Sometimes I like to play a boardgame by myself, if the rules don't need a gamemaster. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sry for the long post, but now that the Middara KS is online it would be cool to decide between those two games.

Just wondering how you guys deal with playing a game for the first time / few times and it didn’t live up to your expectations? Do you give it another chance or move on? 

I’m asking this to decide whether or not to sell off my copy of Concordia. I plan to keep my collection lean (15 games or so) so usually I’m okay with selling off games which I didn’t really enjoy. However Concordia was one of the games I’d always thought I’d love so selling it off feels like a possible mistake. 

I’m not entirely sure what it is about Concordia that I didn’t like as well, as usually good mechanics are what draws me to the game and I think Concordia has excellent mechanics. I suspect that there isn’t enough of a tactical element to Concordia. For example I love how you have to figure out how to allocate/use your dice for this round in Troyes/Marco Polo or respond to what meeples your oppenents put down and what tiles come up in Keyflower.

What I recall is that there are a mess of cards on the table, and the objective of the game is to complete a full set of cards of one type (I vaguely recall it may be dinosaur themed, but I might be wrong) either through putting down x cards and picking up x cards, or trading x cards with someone else (again can't remember if it's either mechanic or both).

The crucial part of the game though, is there are a number of rubber bones on the table, totaling one less than the number of players playing, i.e. if there are 7 players playing there will be 6 bones. Once someone has completed a set of cards, he/she will then discreetly take a bone from the table. For everyone else, once they notice one of the bones is missing, they have to immediately snatch up a bone too, until there are no more bones at the table (at which point the person who didn't grab a bone is the loser).

This was always hilarious fun as we would pretend to keep searching for cards even after all the bones were gone, and there was invariably one person who would keep frantically trying to complete their set long after all the bones had been collected.

Would appreciate any help identifying this game! Thanks!",0.045,0.83,0.125,0.965,6.755
564,t3_c8ra9t,Playing a one vs many game? It's alright to let the larger group win,39,"Little context. We've played a couple games that we're one versus many, and most of the time I seem to be the solo player, which I don't mind at all, but sometimes you need to sacrifice a bit of your enjoyment to make it fun for the other players. In our collection we have Imperial assault, Betrayal, Spectre Ops, and recently acquired fury of dracula, that all fall into this category. 

This week we played Fury of Dracula, which was new to everyone but a couple of us. Our dracula player was on fire. He got 2 weeks in before the hunters even stumbled upon his path (we had bad luck with event draws). The other players at the table HATED the game. The last few rounds were excruciating to get through as they were bitter and resented having to keep playing. So I felt bad as we seemingly wasted a lot of time playing, and me having bought the game, wasted money on something nobody would want to play again. 

Then the next day, they surprisingly wanted to try again. This time I was Drac, and I started in england and did the little loop, just because i thought it would be funny.  They found one of the events that made me reveal part of my path which tipped them off and the chase was on, they laughed at the fact that someone would do that.  I took to the seas,  they chased me, I considered hopping to the one-space island just to throw them off but decided that running wasn't fun, i wanted to give them some action. So I made land, had a couple combats, and was killed when they teamed up for a fight. The other players were much more engaged when they had hope, and a reason to strategize. We talked about the game a while after, discussed strategies, where we went, where we wanted to go, neat cards in our hands we didn't get to use. it was a completely different dynamic. and I didn't feel bad that I lost, I still enjoyed playing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now it's not the other Drac's fault, he was playing the game, trying to allude the hunters as instructed.... But it's such a long game to go through with nothing happening. So in the end, sure its nice to win, but you can still have fun in games like this, and make sure everyone has a good time too.",0.164,0.657,0.179,-0.0567,-2.2113

570,t3_c9bvtb,Impressions of Twice As Clever (Doppelt so clever) - The hottest roll-and-write dice game just became deeper!,21,"***The hottest roll-and-write dice game just became a more satisfying and deeper experience!***

In recent years, the genre of roll-and-write games has been enjoying something of a resurgence. Despite its haters, games like Yahtzee (1956) have always been popular. So rather than criticize this old chestnut for its faults or limitations, why not piggyback on its success, and use it as a stepping stone to introduce fans to the newer generation of roll-and-write games? This class includes the award-winning Qwixx (2012), which has everyone involved even on other player's turns.  Then comes **That's Pretty Clever** (2018), which is a much more meaty game geared to satisfy gamers. It has made a big splash, and has proven very popular. Many gamers will insist that it is their favourite roll-and-write game ever! Like most dice games, it's fast, fun, and addictive, but it adds elements of real strategy and depth. 

And now the following year, along comes its sequel, **Twice As Clever** (2019), with both games being brought to the American market by publisher Stronghold Games. Like the original, this new title comes from designer Wolfgang Warsch, and is a dice-rolling game for 1-4 players, playable in under half an hour. 

**Game-play**

The rules of Twice As Clever are basically the same as That's Pretty Clever, as you're rolling and re-rolling dice, marking off squares in your scoring grid. What's different, however, is a new silver die that lets you score with multiple dice, and also a new power. The result is an even more deep and strategic game! If you liked That's Pretty Clever, but wanted an even greater challenge, then Twice As Clever is the perfect game for you. You'll love this just as much - or if the title is any indication, perhaps twice as much!

**Impressions**

That's Pretty Clever was rightly praised as being a terrific roll-and-write game. What gave it appeal to gamers was that it offered so much more than standard dice-rolling fillers like Yahtzee. Now Twice As Clever (2019) has come along, offering an even more meaty experience. It continues the successful formula of the original, and if you really enjoyed that, you're likely to enjoy this too. The basic concept that made the original game great has been retained, and what has been added are some new scoring possibilities and features. These make it an even more thoughtful and satisfying experience for those who like to really chew on their decisions.

If you're only going to get one of these games, you should make your decision based on your preferred level of complexity and depth. Twice As Clever certainly offers the deeper experience of the two, so if it's a more strategic and meaty game that you are looking for, then this is likely going to be the one you enjoy the most. Even then, you will probably get the most out of it by starting with That's Pretty Clever, playing that over and over until you're ready for a new challenge, and only then moving up to Twice As Clever. On the other hand if you're more likely to enjoy a lighter-medium weight game, then That's Pretty Clever is probably the game to get anyway. While its depth might scare off some gateway gamers, it can also be ideal for the purpose of bringing newcomers to the fold. Either way, That's Pretty Clever is the place that almost everyone should start with, and if you really love it, then you can always move up to Twice As Clever when you want to step up the level of complexity, while offering more of the same style of game-play.

**Recommendation**

Both of these games are great additions to the gaming market. It's wonderful to see the roll-and-write genre being invigorated and populated by titles that don't sacrifice depth of thought. While light dice-rolling fillers like Yahtzee will always be popular in the mass market, it's good to see that there are solid options in the roll-and-write category for gamers as well. And you can't do much better than That's Pretty Clever and its sequel Twice As Clever. Especially for gamers, I recommend them both very highly!

After a few play-testing sessions and changing the design quite a bit, I decided that I was far enough along that I could write up a post for Reddit gauging the interest in a series of “diaries” on what I’d done thus far.

I also posted it on Boardgamegeek.com. I was surprised to see that several of the designers of  the game responded to my original post (turns out I shouldn’t have been surprised, they comment quite often and are very interactive with the Spirit Island player-base). One in particular was Ted Vessenes. His comment sent my mind racing on how I could have done this better:

&gt;I would break down the process like this:  
&gt;  
&gt;**Part 1:** Name and thematic description  
&gt;  
&gt;**Part 2:** Special rule and play style description  
&gt;  
&gt;**Part 3:** Innates  
&gt;  
&gt;**Part 4:** Unique Powers  
&gt;  
&gt;**Part 5:** Growth  
&gt;  
&gt;**Part 6:** Structural testing (""Does it even work?"")  
&gt;  
&gt;**Part 7:** Coherence testing (""Do all the pieces contribute?"")  
&gt;  
&gt;**Part 8:** Balance testing (""Is power level appropriate?"")  
&gt;  
&gt;You might notice that when I choose to respond to custom designs, I'll almost always comment on only the first thing in this list that I think needs design. It's because these things affect each other in layers-- changing the special rule will change what Innate Powers  you want, which can change what unique powers you want. But changing a unique power only rarely makes you want to change special rules.

His comment about how each part affects all the other parts in layers is what struck me. Things needed to be cemented down in a previous part before you could reasonably start on the next part. So I went back down the list with my Spirit and quickly found things that needed to change:

**Assessment:**

* **Part 1 - Name/Description:**
   * Name: Shifting Desert’s Gaping Maw
   * Thematic Description: A Sand Spirit that draws in intruders and devours them
      * Elemental Affinity: Major/Minor/Other
* **Part 2 - Special Rule(s):**
   * Only place Presence in Sands.
      * I was fine with this, I like the limited range aspect of the Spirit, it gives it some obvious flaws that it will have to find a way around in the future.
   * Gather when Presence is placed.
      * Here’s where we run into some problems. It was obvious from the first play-test that this Special Rule was too powerful. The thematic fantasy of the Spirit was already being fulfilled by the second Innate Power, so I didn’t need to add it into the Special Rules as well.
   * Convert Plant and Water into Sun
      * I liked the idea, but was a little strange in execution. It also meant that my Spirit could never help with certain Events that arose during play. That felt bad, so this needed to be changed as well.

So as you can see, I was stopped on only step 2 of 8, revealing to me that I needed to work on the fundamentals once more before I moved on to the actual number-tweaking and other intricate parts of balance.

I brainstormed for quite a while on Special Rules that would help the Spirit be interesting, but not overpowered. I settled on removing the 2nd and 3rd Special Rule and adding in a variant of the 3rd one. It would still do what I wanted, but to a more controllable/interactive level.

That sounded a lot better to me and removing the original gathering Special Rule was an obvious choice anyway. This would still allow me to have larger counts of Sun Elements and would put the Energy I was gaining to good use.

Now I was able to move on to the next piece.

* **Part 3 - Innate Powers**
   * I analyzed the Innate Powers and decided to shift the Elemental thresholds around. I gave the devour Innate Power all the Earth Elements and the gathering Innate Power all of the Sun Elements.
   * I made the gathering Innate Power slow and placed a limit on it by forcing the player to pay Energy (a la the Special Rule) to be able to Gather Invaders.

So now they looked like this:

* The Ravenous Hunger Devours
   * Slow, Range 0, Any
   * Threshold #1: 1 Earth, 1 Sun
      * Deal 2 Damage.
   * Threshold #2: 3 Earth 1 Air, 3 Sun
      * Instead, deal 6 Damage.
   * Threshold #3: 5 Earth 2, Air, 5 Sun
      * Instead, deal 12 Damage.
   * Notes: For each Town or City destroyed by this effect, +1 Fear.
* Mirage Leads to Certain Demise
   * Fast, Range 0, Any
   * Threshold #1: 3 Sun, 1 Air
      * Gather 1 Explorer per Sun
   * Threshold #2: 6 Sun, 2 Air
      * Gather 1 Town per 2 Sun.
   * Threshold #3: 10 Sun, 4 Air
      * Gather all Explorers or Towns.
   * Threshold #4: 5 Air
      * You may repeat the Power.

With a new set of Innate Powers that seemed harder to reach, but just as rewarding for doing so (or so I thought), I moved on to the next part.

* **Part 4 - Unique Power Cards:**
   * Bottomless Pits of Quicksand -&gt; Blinding Sandstorms
      * 3 Cost, Fast, Range 1, Any land
      * Invaders skip all Actions in target land this turn.
      * Elements: Sun/Air/Earth
   * Scorch with Desert Heat
      * 2-&gt;1 Cost, Slow, Range 1, Any land
      * 1 Damage
      * \+1 Damage if target land is Sand
      * Elements: Sun/Fire/Air -&gt; Sun/Fire
   * Singing Dunes of Sand -&gt; Grit and Gravel Chip Away
      * 1 Cost, Slow, Range 1, Any land
      * 1 Damage to each Town/City.
      * Elements: Earth/Fire
   * Thrashing Walls of Sand -&gt; Smothering Wall of Sand
      * 2 Cost, Slow, Range 1, Any land
      * 1 Fear.
      * Push up to 3 Explorers/Towns/Dahan OR Destroy 1 Town.
      * Elements: Air/Fire/Earth/Sun

The Unique Power Cards changed the most since I wasn’t happy with how most of them played in the first play-test. Turns out I still had a lot to learn when it comes to crafting Unique Power Cards in general in terms of effects and balance. These would continue to change and fluctuate from this point all the way to the end of the balancing cycle.

* **Part 5 - Growth Options:**
   * Reclaim All, Gain a Power Card -&gt; Reclaim All, Gain 1 Energy, Gain Earth OR Sun
   * Add a Presence (Range 3), Gain a Power Card.
   * Add a Presence (Range 0), Gain 2 Energy.

Shifting Desert isn’t primarily an Earth Spirit, so I didn’t want the Reclaim to be terribly strong. But it has Earth as the secondary Element, so I wanted it to be slightly better than some Reclaim All combinations.

Parts 6 through 8 are for play-testing, so I’m not going to go into that any more in this article.

So now you’ve seen how a lot of things can be revealed when play-testing what you’ve created. These revelations can in turn change a lot of the design of your Spirit (especially when your fundamentals aren’t in place completely).

I recommend anyone who wants to make their own Spirit follow the advice given above. It makes the process more streamlined and helps to identify problems earlier in the design.

Next time will be the final article where I reveal what I consider to be the (nearly) finished Spirit and give tips for how to play-test efficiently in addition to a smattering of lessons that I learned that I think will be useful to everyone else who attempts something like this.",0.064,0.788,0.148,0.9981,45.9126
584,t3_c93re4,[Game of Thrones Board Game] Mother of Dragons Arryn setup when playing without Targaryen/Essos board,19,"Hi everyone

Last time we played a match of GoT, we decided to do a 7 player match without the Targaryen house and board to see how including the Arryn would change the original game dynamics.

As far as I remember, the manual doesn't explicitly say that you can't play as Arryn without Targaryen (it specifically says to always put the Eyrie extensor over the original game - the Essos board is only included if someone picked Targ) and I've searched on BGG/similar forums - it was universally accepted that wasn't an issue.

However, the only thing that bothered us was their initial unit setup. They get three knights and a boat from the get go? Is that right? We've looked through the MoD manual and it doesn't say anything about their setup without Essos.

We thought they felt somewhat overpowered due to that (and the Eyrie being a 4 point-strong garrison) so that even a moderately skilled player could steamroll Baratheon (and to a lesser extent Stark) quite easily.

Is there something we aren't getting or that's just the way it is? Does having Arryn in a 7 player game changes initial unit setup for other houses? Are there any official/unnoficial rules talking about this?

3. Regarding the event ""imperial attack"", what would the neutral protector and drop troops fight against? Would they battle the troops stated on the system tile or would they fight the player's units that are present there? If the imperial troops defeat the system, does the player that activated the event gain control of the system or does the original owner of the system just lose control of the system?

The game was going nicely, we were having fun, until one of them has noticed that every time a card was passed to me, I was taking a look at my own hand of cards, trying to figure out what are chances that the person giving me the card is lying about what's on it.

After noticing this, she has immediately accused me of cheating and both of them quit the game and told me to never bring it again. 

At first this completely shocked me because I had assumed that they were doing the same thing, looking at the cards already in front of us and the ones in their own hands, in order to determine which cards are still in play. Obviously this wasn't the case, and they were basically playing blind, only relying on their social skills to call the bluffs.

She has argued that the game is about calling bluffs and it goes against the spirit of the game to statistically determine which cards are still in play. Which makes some sense but at the same time it can't possibly be cheating to look at your own hand, can it?

The rules doesn't say it explicitly, but it seems so ridiculous to me. Still, it left a sour taste in my mouth and I'm not sure if I want to play the game again.

593,t3_c94x1g,I made a variant to The Great Dalmuti. Would Love to hear your thoughts on it. It Involves the Jester of Death and the Jester of Good Fortune. Thinking about Calling it The Greatest Dalmuti.,7,"This post assumes you know the rules to the game called The Great Dalmuti.  I am sure there are rules descriptions of it on YouTube if you need a refresher

This variant gives the Greater/Lesser Peons more power and makes it more fun to be on the bottom,

How to play this variant:
In the beginning of the game, Before Taxation,  The Greater and Lesser Peons conspire against the Great Dalmuti by picking one Jester to be the Jester of Death.  The other a Jester is called the Jester of Good Fortune.  

This is done with everyone’s eyes closed except the Peons at the beginning of a round.

After the Jester of Death has been decided play a round as normal.


The Jester card plays the same just like in the normal game of Dalmuti,  it’s rank 13 or you can play it as an additional card just like normal.

If the Jester gets played with any card 4 or lower, it has entered the castle.

Jesters that have entered the castle, at the very end of the of the round activate.  

If the Jester of Death activates at the end of the round, something bad happens to the Great Dalmuti.  Here is what I was thinking.


1. Disgrace the Greater Dalmuti ( they can never ever be Dalmuti again)
2. Killing the Greater Dalmuti ( The Greater dalmuti is eliminated from the game)


If the Jester of Good fortune activates, something good happens to the dalmuti, Here is what I was thinking.

1.The Greater Dalmuti ascends to the position of the Greatest Dalmuti. Which means there are 3 positions of royalty now,  Lesser dalmuti,  Great dalmuti and the Greatest Dalmuti.  (The highest merchant becomes the lesser dalmuti. Everyone else moves up, except merchants and peons)



This makes it more fun to be a Peon and adds a guessing game to the Dalmuti gameplay with additional mind games.


Now if you made it this far thank you for reading.  

I came up with a way for the royalty to shoo a Jester away before the Jesters activate.

The three cards in the game are called the Earl Marshall’s.  But in this variant,  One of them is Called the Supreme Earl Marshall and this card can get rid of a Jester that has entered the castle.


I’m not sure exactly when it gets rid of a Jester that has entered the castle.

Maybe after it is played?

Or who ever has played the Supreme Earl Marshall, can decided whether to shoo a Jester away at the end of the Game.

What do you think or recommend?

Final question.

I’m curious to hear your thoughts,  if both Jesters are in the castle at the end of the round, what happens?

Does the Dalmuti pick one (hoping he picks the Good Fortune Jester)

Or do both Jesters cancel each other out.

I like the Dalmuti picking one.  What are your thoughts?  I am very excited to play test this.",0.048,0.765,0.187,0.997,6.979
594,t3_c8xmcn,How much have you spent on this hobby?,81,"See title.

Out of curiosity, I copied my BGG collection into an excel file and listed my expenses in this hobby since I’ve started. Most of my receipts are available either in my email, on amazon, or on target. There were only a handful that I had to guess prices for.

I’ve been collecting for about 4-5 years now. My BGG collection sits at 110, including expansions. Minus expansions i have 67 games. 

I estimated I spent about $3400 on games, and about another $100 on a folding table and kallax shelves. 

This doesn’t include two kickstarters I’ve currently backed and am awaiting.

The bulk of my expenses come from backing a couple of expensive all-in kickstarters (Xia, Dinosaur Island, Aeons End, Batman Gotham City Chronicles, 7th continent).. and of course KDM and it’s wave 1 expansions also added up, but I was able to back these before they were full price.

Barring these, the rest of my collection ($1300) were usually purchased when games were marked as “all time lows” on ccc, clearance sales, B2G1 deals, and a couple of B&amp;N $2 clearance deals. I think the only game I paid full price for (nonkickstarter) was Catan and some of its expansions.. my first introduction into tabletop games. 

That being said, if you had to estimate- how much have you dropped on your collection? Do you feel as if the entertainment had was worth the cost?

If I had to guess, I’ve probably had 50 game nights over the past 5 years.. so $70/night? Never mind that i have about 15 unplayed games, 20+ unplayed expansions, and several games played once! Nevertheless, you could do a lot worse for a night out.

Edit: looks like we got a huge bell curve of numbers here! 

Here’s a tool that will estimate your BGG value (based on market prices, and doesn’t take into consideration Kickstarter versions and exclusives.) It doesn’t equal what you actually paid tho.. I paid less than my collection is worth.

After 2 years of working on my board game ""Werewolf vs. Vampire"", I would like to offer to write a developer diary for the game.

It's about all the small steps after the offer - to the finished product including shipping.

My question is, are you interested?

Leave me a comment.

&amp;#x200B;

I started to keep the diary on Facebook and so I already listed the first 5 days here. If you like this, I would post more diary entries here once a week.

&amp;#x200B;

As previous knowledge is still important that I had a campaign on Kickstarter, which I had to stop. Why, you can read here:

## Day 1

Finally I agreed with a developing company  on the production settings. They are going to send me templates for the different items.

## Day 2

I have received the following question:  
 Why did you cancel the last Kickstarter campaign?

**The short answer**  
 3D Minis

**Detail answer**  
 In the first campaign, a lot of people asked about my minis. So, in order to do everything right in the second campaign, I offered minis.  
 I had to stop the last Kickstarter campaign because only 3 people wanted them.   
 Therefore, I was in a dilemma.

&amp;#x200B;

If I get 2 Minis produced, there is a one-time amount of about 2,300 euros.   
 Even if everyone buys miniatures this costs about 10 Euro on Kickstarter (5€ + Kickstarter costs + financial institution + returns).

&amp;#x200B;

But for 10 Euro apparently only 3 people were willed to buy these. So I would not only have to cover for the costs for 300 games, but also the costs for 497 minis.

## Day 3

I told you that on Kickstarter not all supporters wanted miniatures for 10 Euro.

At the same time, it was not possible for me to keep this offer for 3 bidders.

&amp;#x200B;

But now to the solution for the miniatures problem.

Since the campaign a lot of time has gone by and I have been looking a lot for 3D miniatures solutions. For a long time, I didn't find anything that met my quality standards.

A few approaches:

\- Smallest production quantity: the price per miniature is then 7.50€ So even more money and even fewer supporters who want to have the product then.

\- DIY 3D printing (filament): Absolutely not. Apart from the fact that the people, who try to get good results of 3D printing spend a LITTLE more time on this task - the result is not sufficient for me. Of course, you can get better results, but only by using sandpaper and a LOT of time.

&amp;#x200B;

Then by chance I became aware of another printing process.

&amp;#x200B;

From time to time I enter search terms at different platforms and on a wonderful Wednesday evening this was '3D printing' on Kickstarter. The result was a printing process that I hadn't really followed until then, as the printers were at 2,300 Euros.

Now the price was below 300 Euros. So I sent a mail to the 3D nerd I trust and asked if that could be good and promptly received the answer ""No, they start at over 2k Euros"".

After I had sent the link, the statement changed into: ""Wow, that sounds pretty good.""

&amp;#x200B;

So, I supported the printer. But everyone who is involved with Kickstarter also knows that many projects in the field of technology failed.

&amp;#x200B;

But I wanted to know more about it and have really been involved with the printing process in detail. And look at that, on Amazon there was an almost equivalent printer with a 20 Euro discount and one material for free. Another 2 days later I ordered the printer.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I say:

\- Easy to use

\- Real fun

\- Super results (professional)

&amp;#x200B;

I then took the first results with me to my 3D friend and because of the miniatures I printed out with them, another printer was sold immediately.

&amp;#x200B;

The printouts so far look so good that I am convinced that I can produce small quantities at at least the same price.

&amp;#x200B;

That way I won't run into the same trap again for the next campaign and can even offer a little highlight. But that won't be revealed yet.

## Day 4

Today I would like to say something about the decision on the production quantity.

&amp;#x200B;

A large part of the decision was taken from me:

&amp;#x200B;

When you produce a game, there's always a minimum quantity that you have to buy.

For most of the manufacturers I wrote to, this is 500. Others want to sell at least 1500 pieces.

&amp;#x200B;

I've read in many forums that at the end of a Kickstarter campaign you can sell the same amount through other distribution channels. That should then include Amazon, Ebay, dealers, game events and this should also be the end of sales.

&amp;#x200B;

In my first campaign, I had oriented myself to other titles and wanted to recoup production costs as much as possible. Therefore, I had specified 8,000€ as target mark. That would have been about 365 supporters. But I landed at 80 (some jumped off towards the end).

With the improved second campaign I had to break off with almost 60 supporters. I think I could have got 120 supporters here.

&amp;#x200B;

So, let's stay with 120 supporters. If I could sell that much again in post-sale, I should make 240 pieces.

&amp;#x200B;

The temptation to produce more is huge, because the different production quantities don't cost so much at the end of the day.

&amp;#x200B;

When I compared the offers, the following came out.

500 pieces á 15€ - 7.500€

1.500 pcs á 7€ - 10.500€ each

&amp;#x200B;

But since I would already have 260 games on stock at the moment, I don't have to spend 3.000€ to fill the stock completely with them.

&amp;#x200B;

I even found a company that would have produced 260 games for me. 

Now guess what it would have cost: right - 7.500 Euro.

## Day 5

Today I would like to talk about the different offers I got for 10-sided dice. There are always surprising differences, which can be clarified, but are by no means obvious.

   
 

This statement can be used almost 1:1 for all other components.

   
 

For 500 pieces:

   
 

ID..each…development cost

A....0.18…………. € 260 € 

B....0.13…………...€ 0 €

C....0.54…………...€ 0 €

   
 

That looks very clearly like offer B. 

Only by explicit asking I found this (after several requests😊).

   
 

What does development cost mean in dice production?

For dice ""templates"" have to be made. These are good for 5,000 dice. A new tepmlate must be made, even if only the colors are minimally different.

   
 

And why do some of them manage without development costs?

They don't. Offer B is only based on the assumption that the manufacturer still has such similar dice in stock (someone else had perhaps only taken 500 of the 5,000 and so dice are left). 

But since I want to have a certain color combination, a template has to be made.

   
 

But why does offer C have no development costs?

That is simply math: 

Offer A) 500 pcs. x 0.18 € + 260 € = 350€

Offer C) 500 pcs. x 0.70 € + 000 € = 350 €

Offer C has therefore simply passed on the development costs to each individual die.

Amazing gateway game!,56,"My group of friends is a bunch of 18-36 year old Olympic athletes that train all day and have never been into gaming or video games or anything of that nature. When I first started coming around I would introduce card games and small party games, but most recently I took out Space Base by John D. Clair and watched as they all looked in horror at the size of the box and rulebook.. (TI is my favorite game so I found this funny..) 
But, with trust in me they accepted to play and by turn 5 they were hooked! It became the game we played every day and we even had to start a rotation so everyone could play! I've never seen a game turn so many people onto a little heavier play as well as Space Base! Now when I took out Terra Mystica they were much more willing to learn and give it a shot!

After playing this one for the first time at Origins, I was so glad to get it to the table and play it a few times this week before recording this. I'll be doing a formal review in the next week or so, but it's fair to say that we enjoyed this one quiet a bit at two players.

I'm definitely wanting to get this one to the table especially with an eventual expansion in the works [per the designer, Seth Jaffee, on his blog](http://sedjtroll.blogspot.com/2019/03/prototype-feast-or-famine.html)!

614,t3_c96d4j,On SUSD and rules,327,"Let me be a jerk for a moment and criticize one of my most beloved game reviewers, SUSD. They were the ones that re-ignited my passion for board games  with their fantastic review of Azul (Paul!). They are always entertaining and often include fascinating segments in their reviews, like that time they discussed orientalism and the place of women (that is, none) in Istanbul. Their recent podcast featuring the book ""Top 10 Games You Can Play In Your Head, By Yourself"" was the best and most original gaming content I've heard in a long while. Even my reddit name is an homage to one of their reviews. That said, something about them has been nagging me for some time and I just had to voice it out. It probably bugs me more because I like them so much.

They so often get the rules of their games wrong.

It occurs so often that I can't help but notice it. It happened for Gugong recently: they said game was good but a bit underwhelming, and a commenter on their site wrote ""You were using the double servant wrong"", to which Quinns replied "" I checked the rules on this *three time*s and still apparently got it wrong?"". Of course it makes you wonder: would they have liked the game better if they played it right? Probably. Maybe? And now almost 100k viewers saw the ""underwhelmed"" video review, and in the currently saturated games market, this means most of those people are probably going to pass on the game.

It happened with their playthrough of Gloomhaven. A Youtube commenter wrote a list of 10 (!) rules errors they made in the video. But didn't Matt spend hours and hours creating a wonderfully produced 35 minutes review of the game about a year before? Did he do all the playtesting, script writing, video shooting and editing, the review was seen by 675k people... and he had the rules wrong all along? Did he just forget them?

This happens with very simple games too. Have a look at their Gin Rummy video, even then Quinns makes lots of rules mistakes. Which are corrected in text overlays, but then they appear so often that it becomes hard to follow. And as an internet jerk who comfortably enjoys your free content and hard labour, let me ask a very naive question: for a video where the whole point is to teach the game, for a simple game that you just taught in 5 minutes not counting a bit of banter... why not just reshoot the whole thing on the spot and make it right? What's the point of a rules video where the rules are wrong?

It happened again with the very simple press-your-luck game ""That’s Not Lemonade"" (18 cards and a few cups) they described as being not very good in their podcast. In the next one they noted the designer had contacted them saying that they had missed a central rule of the game, which made it way less dumb than they had presented it. How could they still get such a simple game wrong, especially when they feature it on their podcast? And then I remembered them saying how they played Skull wrong for a long time at first, with people bidding free-for-all instead of in order. Which luckily for this other games publisher made the game more fun for them this time. But when you cannot grasp the rules of a game like Skull, of course you're going to make mistakes with Gugong and Gloomhaven.

Granted, most of these games, they acknowledged the errors on their website or in a follow-up podcast. And of course it is hard to get rules right when you have to try so many in a week. Errors happen of course, it's fine. But then in this case it looks like it's becoming systematic. I can't help but get annoyed, because those recurring mistakes make me doubt the value of all their other very entertaining reviews. Especially for games with complex rules like Lisboa and Root, and for games they say they did not enjoy. The writing is top-notch, the video production stellar... but if I can't trust the review is it worth it?

Many of my friends who play occasionaly don't care much about rules. When they open their brand new game, they skim the rules to get to play as fast as possible. And who cares, right? Isn't the goal to have fun? They are surprised when they play the same game with me and the rules are way different than they remember. SUSD has also been focused from the start on having fun with your friends, and that is for the best. But as game reviewers with hundreds of thousands of viewers, shouldn't they be held to a higher standard? Am I the only one noticing or caring about this?",0.09,0.757,0.153,0.9961,325.7247

How long have I been involved in the hobby? I started collecting back Pandemic first hit the scene, was super hyped when Z-Man was crowd funding Agricola, dove into Arkham 2nd Ed. but then things started to fall off when I couldn't really find anyone to play with. Fast forward to about early 2016 when I was able to find a great group of people willing to put up with my board gaming, now we get together and play about once a week.

What would I change about my collection if I could? Honestly not much, while there is lots of my shelf that doesn't get a ton of play anymore it's all part of the evolution that got me to the board games I play today. Gloomhaven is probably the number one game that I own that I should play but have no intentions of ever playing again. I've played it twice, I can completely see the brilliance behind it and that it's an amazing game, but just due to the setup/teardown time (I even built a foamcore organizer for it to try and help) and the amount of rule finickyness - I just never plan to touch it again.

One of my biggest board gaming mistakes is waiting too long to try an 18XX game! I thought they'd be so technical and dry, I was put off by the long playtimes and intimidating rulesets but after I finally tried one our group is hooked, 1830 hits the table more now than any other game by a pretty large margin. Anyone that even thinks they'd like an economic/stock market based game needs needs needs to try an 18XX. Don't let the look of them put you off, they're dynamic, cut throat and more exciting than most games out there.

I have cool stuff on the horizon! Anxiously awaiting games like Pax Pamir 2nd to arrive, Age of Steam reprint, Trickerion and a few others.

Some of the old games like HeroQuest are from my childhood (just found a second copy for $5.99 at Value Village last week) but a lot of the random stuff in there are second hand store finds or stuff I've intentionally collected over time.

I was thinking about picking up eastern front and winter wars but I see that many people recommend to pick up winter wars along with the breakthrough expansion since it’s comes with a breakthrough deck. Since breakthrough is also unavailable, I wanted to know if it’s still worth picking up winter wars when I purchase eastern front expansion? Is there enough content in winter wars if only playing with the base board and eastern front?

647,t3_c9y5sd,[COMC] A little over a year of collecting and really getting into it!,36,"Hi All!

&amp;#x200B;

[Here's the link to my collection.](https://i.imgur.com/CTgDU8x.jpg) I always enjoy the discussions generated by the COMC posts, so I figured I'd finally do my own! I've been playing the ""classics"" most of my life, like Monopoly and Risk. About 2 years ago I started playing games at various friends' house like Dominion, Lords of Waterdeep, Pandemic, Codenames, and 7 Wonders. I was one of those people that didn't know board games existed beyond Monopoly and Risk. My wife and I and the couple that owns Dominion and Lords of Waterdeep decided that we should take turns buying games to play together, and I started with The Others (sort of a mistake!). May 2018 is when I first started really getting into the hobby when I decided I wanted to mess around designing my own board game with a work friend. As a part of my research into the concepts I was interested in, I started listening to the Dice Tower's Top Ten videos to learn about games in general and that opened up the world of board games to me. I eventually started listening to Shut Up and Sit Down podcasts on my drive to work, when mowing the lawn, etc. and the rest is kind of history. I've listened to their podcasts probably 3+ times each now and while I don't always agree with their opinions of games, I still think they're some of the best in the industry right now in terms of content.

I'm glad to have owned/played most of the games I currently own, but I'd probably get rid of a few, especially now that my bookshelf is running out of space. The bottom shelf is the aforementioned ""classics"" that sit there until I run out of room on my shelves. I'll get into dislikes later in the post. Some others mention their gaming table and gaming room in their COMC posts. I'll just briefly say I don't have a specific room or table, I just use the 6'x3' dinner table in my dining room. WOrks for basically everything up to TI4 (which requires side tables for each player).

&amp;#x200B;

*Favorites*

**7th Continent** \- This game is excellent. I didn't play any Choose Your Own Adventure games when I was a kid so its exciting to play something similar. I play 4-player with my wife and two friends and so far it's been a real hit. I have I think 8 curses from stretch goals on the Kickstarter and I have a feeling we will be playing this one for a long time. Kickstarted this before I really got deep into the hobby and the wait was worth it!

**Twilight Imperium** \- I've only played it once, but I'm a pretty big space nerd and the ""space opera"" thing is right up my alley. If I had friends that wanted to play it more often, I'd probably play it every weekend.

**Terraforming Mars** \- Just got to play this for the first time the other day, and again, as a space nerd, the theme is fantastic. I really enjoy engine builders in general and the vast number of well-themed cards available make me look forward to playing this more. Bought some plastic player board overlays to prevent things from shifting.

**Scythe** \- Scythe was the second game I bought after The Others, and I've probably played it the most. I like games that have multiple strategies to achieve the victory, and I enjoy variable player powers, so this is a great one for me. I rate it lower than the others because I'm not a fan of some of the mechanics like civilizations warping across the map, or the ""can't take the same action twice"" thing, but I can house rule those away if needed.

**7 Wonders Duel** \- Honorable mention, this and the Lord of the Rings deck builder are the only games I can get my wife to reliably play. She isn't a huge fan of board games, which is totally fine, but she enjoys this. She beats me every time too which is maddening but I've learned to live with it.

&amp;#x200B;

*Dislikes*

**Forbidden Island/Desert** \- Too simple for my taste (I lean towards heavier games).

**The Others** \- I can't stand games that are designed to be ""serious"" and resolve important things with dice rolls. I can understand losing a game to a bad dice roll in Dice Throne or Dice Forge, or using dice that can be manipulated like in Castles of Burgundy, but The Others feels like an exercise in futility sometimes. YMMV on this game for sure because it's heavily dependent on group dynamic, having played it quite a few times with my group.

**Catan** \- I've only played base Catan, and only with the beginner setup suggested in the rules. I'm told that making your own map, starting positions, and using expansions improve the fun. Definitely want to try that next time.

&amp;#x200B;

*Yet to Play*

**Spirit Island** \- Got this for my birthday 3 months ago and just haven't had a chance to play with a group. Expecting this to be a huge hit in my group where we have a strong quarterbacking problem.

**Above and Below** \- Bought on clearance and the theme looked fun, just haven't gotten it to the table yet.

**Endogenesis** \- Just got my Kickstarter edition a few days ago! Really looking forward to finding time to play it. The game was made by an active Redditor here /u/davidgoh2099 and his art design is killer.

**Unearth** \- Clearance buy, excellent artwork and enjoyable ""working"" dice rolling mechanics.

**Seafall** \- Clearance buy, legacy games are hard to get to the table. I have one couple that I want to play games like this with and they're busier than we are. Heard big backlash on this but I don't see it being hated by my group (finger's crossed).

**Red Scare** \- Clearance buy (Barnes &amp; Noble clearance can be great), my foray into hidden roles. Have played things like Secret Hitler and Avalon and this was like $4 on clearance, so I figured no harm if we all hate it.

**7th Continent: What Goes Up...** \- Just got my 7th Continent Kickstarter about 3 weeks ago, and we have been playing the first curse. As far as I know, the expansion stuff (specifically the balloon and barge) don't come into play until later curses.

&amp;#x200B;

*Kickstarter Preordered*

**On Mars** \- Kickstarter for On Mars just ended recently. Sounds like it'll only be a few months until it arrives. Never played a Lacerda game and I hear his games are complicated. I'm hoping the group I play with who prefers heavier games will really enjoy this one.

&amp;#x200B;

*Wishlist*

***Inis*** *-* This looks really fun to me and I don't have many strictly area control games. I love well-themed games as well and have only heard good things.

**Xia: Legends of a Drift System (and expansion)** \- On the other hand, I *have* heard some bad things about Xia but that they are improved with the expansion. Just gotta wait for another Kickstarter I guess.

**The Quest for El Dorado** \- Sounds like a fun Deck Builder. I really hate the dryness of Deck Builders like Dominion (and Lord of the Rings, to be fair), and like the idea of using my deck to do something.

&amp;#x200B;

*A quick rundown on the rest*

**Dice Forge** is the best-made game I've ever seen, and the gameplay is decent enough. **Fog of Love** didn't go well with my wife just because the role-playing thing isn't for her. **Onitama**, **Welcome to the Dungeon**, and **Among the Stars** are all fine, simple games. The third shelf has various games of the 6-8 range of BGG ratings. They're good with the right group. Really like **Santorini** for its chess-like feel and simplicity, yet decent variability in available strategies. **Starfall** is decently fun. **Escape Room The Game** would be cool but the device it comes with just didn't work.

&amp;#x200B;

*Other*

This is by no means an ad for the games I'm developing but I figured I'd add them to the end since they're a big part of the existence of my collection. I design these with /u/knighttim in our free time and while fun, it's hard to say if we'll ever be able to get them produced. Rating the ""completion"" of the games at the end of each.

**Festival of the Gladiator** \- 2-6 player card drafting + deck building character-builder. Like I mentioned before, I like deck builders where you do something with your deck other than using it to do more deck building. Players fight each other or monsters in a mythological Greco-roman colosseum. Rules 100%, Cards 99%, Art 75%.

**Ascendance of the Archmage** \- 2-6 player Twilight Imperium style map with smaller hexes and cubes for units. No dice combat. Focused on building resource economies (euro style), constructing buildings for new worker placement slots, networking with allies (and foes), and using spells in war. Rules 95%, Cards 5%, Art 0%.

**Pan's Garden** \- 4 player area control + asymmetric player powers (sort of like Root). Newest one in-work, so not much to speak of. Rules 40%, Cards 0%, Art 0%.

648,t3_ca0amm,My issue with Star Wars: Rebellion,16,"I've played Star Wars Rebellion 10-15 times now, and I've enjoyed each and every game. The issue is, I'm beginning to enjoy it less and less because of a flaw in the game. 

To me, combat seems like complete tedium at this point. The first few games it was so much fun to Chuck dice and see all the tactic cards, playing out epic climactic battles. At this point for me, the theme is beginning to fade, and the mechanics are more apparent to me now. 

Combat just seems... Repetitive? It's a chore at this point. I play Twilight Imperium, and in that game, the space combat has to be won first, then the ground combat. One of my many issues with Rebellions combat system is that I only have to bring a single assault carrier an some strong ground troops into a system if I want to take the planet. Sure, my assault carrier will be obliterated, but my troops will get on the ground safely. In this way, it makes me feel like amassing space troops (especially as the empire, who will always have the superior number of troops), is pointless. I'll beat the rebels pretty easily because I make troops so much easier as I start with more systems. 

Next, the tactic cards. This is a complete mess to me. Having to shuffle and deal little deck every single time I want to start a new combat is so boring. Yes, it makes certain leaders stronger in combat than others (which I appreciate), but there isn't much variety, and it feels like a cheap move so that the same dice can be used on skill checks and combat. 

I have sort of burned out on the combat in this game, especially playing war games like Root and Sekigahara (which are not the same genre as Rebellion, but Root has a 5 second combat system, and Sekigahara is so strategic in combat). 

What have other fans of this game done to keep combat exciting? Does the expansion fix it? What should I do differently, if anything?

Thanks in advance for the responses.",0.132,0.689,0.179,0.9727,15.5632
649,t3_c9tlp0,As a new player; how do you decide what games to purchase?,99,"As a new player to the board game scene, looking up games to play in a vast variety of genres and the amount that are available is quite daunting.

Games played in the past are the general family games; monopoly, scrabble and payday types but years ago dabbled in Talisman as a young teen and loved it but went back to video games. Over the years interest in video games just become less and less but recently the general family games have been hitting the dining table but wanting a new challenge.

Income is good but not to a point where its like oh this game looks awesome but a little pricey but order it, its not that great, put it on the shelf, lets look for another.

So when you started out, how did you used to narrow down which game to buy? 

After purchasing a few games did you make tweaks to how you decided, What were they and how do you now?

Also another factor in purchasing a game, is backing a game, either through Kickstarter. Maybe wrong but seems a lot of table top games get kickstarters and stay as only kickstarter games. 

Should a new player in table top games even be looking at backing games?

Do you use the same process you use to determine if you should back it as if you were purchasing a retail game? Or do you even bother and hope a game on kickstarter becomes available after its campaign. Like I have seen 7th continent on many top 10 lists and is only a kickstarter game, is that a risk you take?",0.048,0.803,0.149,0.9792,96.9408
650,t3_c9ydnc,[COMC] For the first time in 4 years into the hobby I decided to see all of my collection in one place.,27,"I've recently finished my latest math trade and received every Kickstarter I expect to get this year. So I figured it's time to get all my games out of closet to see them all in one place.

[BGG collection](https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/Niarlat)

(Not pictured here are all 12 Kingdom Death expansions and 10 MtG Ravnica Guild Kits.)

The game that brought me into the hobby was **Kingdom Death**. I was an avid PC gamer and when Kickstarter became popular I enjoyed looking for cool projects. Imagine my surprise when I found some strange game with miniatures among top trending projects. I decided to check it out and was absolutely blown away. I knew I wanted to get into this ""Kingdom Death"" but I decided that 100$ is too much for a game that I likely won't ever play with anyone. And then there were all the expansions that made the whole thing unreasonable.

Well, today I have a group of 25-30 people to play with, nice boardgame collection and a fully backed project for Kingdom Death 2nd printing. Never was I so happy to turn out wrong!

The first game I bought was **Dixit** and it still sits comfortably as the 'chill' game when you need to vent after heated meetup.

It is really hard to name favorites but I really wish I could play more **Captain Sonar**, **Battlestar Galactica**, **Eclipse** and **Vast**!

My biggest letdowns are **TIME Stories**, **Mansions of Madness 2nd ed**. and **Dead of Winter**.

Recently I discovered math trade and got rid of:

 *  **Smash Up!** (too long and complex for a filler, too shallow for a main spot)
 *  **Pandemic** (didn't like it at all, felt like it's really a solo game with some characters strictly better then others)
 *  **Betrayal at House On The Hill** (it was a hit 3 years ago, rarely played nowadays. Has an option of returning as Legacy variant.)
 *  **Smallworld** (can't pinpoint what I didn't like but it felt bland)
 *  **Mage Knight** (to make space for an Ultimate Edition, the game is amazing!)

Overall, I think things I like the most in games are player interaction, theme and some unique features.

I would love to expand my collection into some categories and mechanics that are missing. Namely, I am looking into worker placement but find that most games in this category don't actually DO anything with placing the worker except for giving you resource X or some Victory Points. I recently discovered **Dominant Species** as a game in this genre I would maybe like but still not sure.

655,t3_ca136c,Does anyone play the Potion Explosion app in lieu of the boardgame?,7,"Hi, reddit boardgamers. 

My bg circle and I are looking to shift some games from table top to app, where we can play remotely. Furthermore, we're looking to gravitate towards app for those games where it's one person turns at a time and then it's just a lot of waiting. 

We've done this with Lord/Waterdeep and we love it. It's a game we can play indefinitely. 

We want to do it with a couple more boardgames and the next one we're looking at is Potion Explosion. I just have a few questions for anyone that has played it since I've haven't used an Asmondee Digital app before: 

(1) does the game cross multiple os (iOS and Android)? 
(2) is the game compatible with phones or are tablets needed? 
(3) if it is compatible with phones, is it manageable given the small screen real estate some phones have? 
(4) is there an add-friend system where you and your friends can set up private matches? Or is this game pass-and-play multiplayer only? 
(5) (probably the most important question) - if there is an add-friend and set up private match options, are there push notifications to tell you when it's your turn and if so, is it reliable?

This is the biggest game I’ve played, I’m still having trouble seeing the big picture in some ways and knowing what strategies are good. If that makes sense. Some cards just seem pointless. For example, the rebel sabotage card. The Empire has a card that lets them remove a sabotage marker. Wife (Empire) would play the mission every time so I if I played hype sabotage card it was a pointless mission. This makes it very difficult to complete that one objective that requires 3 sabotage markers to be out.  

I guess my questions are: what are some goo strategies for both sides? Also, if you think of any rules that are often forgotten or misunderstood I’d like to know those as well to make sure we’re doing everything right. We both have really enjoyed the game.

All I can say is WoW! I was so impressed with how deep and exciting every move was with this game. This game checks so many boxes for me:
1. Worker placement
2. Area control
3. Combos and Tableau Engine building
4. Amazing miniatures
5. Fast paced and significant combat
6. Theme: A game dripping with an awesome fantasy world
7. A ripe magic system with amazing game changing effects
8. Resource management 
9. Quality components 
10. Multiple asymmetric factions with their own unique abilities
11. High replay-ability with each game being unique having a new hex tile board every time. 
12. Amazing scale-ability from a well thought out solo game to amazing 5 player action. 

I could go on, but I just get the feeling that this game could be the next Scythe. So I wanted to see if people have played it and/or demoed it and what were their reactions to it?

666,t3_c9zvno,Terminology Help: “Reference-Only” pieces and rules,3,"I’m almost always the one owning and teaching the games in my group, which I enjoy just fine.  I like to iron out the kinks in my teaching style that hinder player enjoyment, so here’s one that has been bugging me for a while.

Many games have specific generic pieces, chits, cards or conditions that have no inherent effect.  They can’t be spent as a resource or used to perform or modify any action.  These pieces are just *there* until another card ability calls on them.  Something like, “If [player] has [piece], he discards a card.”  

I am looking for a snappy term to describe this kind of mechanism in games.  When teaching like 9 games to family over vacation last week, I realized that my players often got hung up on bits like this; many games refer to these pieces offhandedly like you should know what they mean, so new players become anxious about the dark spot in their knowledge.  I would like to “skip over” that anxiety when teaching by using a generic term that can describe them in any game - something that makes my regular player group say, “ohhh, gotcha.”

A prime example would be Virus Counters in *Netrunner*.  These chits produce no inherent effect, but the cards that call to produce them ascribe effects to them (usually).  Virus counters mean nothing for either player without context.  Same for agenda counters, power counters, and tags, sort of.

Root has a decent example in Items.  For most players, items have no inherent effect; their icons are only meaningful due to the game’s scarcity of items.  For the Vagabond, the faction board transforms meaningless chits into an entire gameplay system.  Every unique piece gets a unique action or provides a boost.  So these pieces *kind of* fit the bill.  

  (You could also say the Star die faces in King of NY fit the bill since they are contexualized only by the Superstar card, but that’s, uh, dicey.)

Does this make sense?  Does the terminology exist?  Any help is appreciated. Thanks!",0.054,0.83,0.116,0.9618,2.8853999999999997

Citadel

Battle of Rokugan


I noticed that those game have some ""take that"" mechanic and when I got a lot of that from many players I will get seriously annoyed and really want to leave. 

I usually stay away from those game because I do not want to be triggered

Yesterday while playing Citadel for the first time, I  got assassinated and got robbed in 1st-2nd turn. It feel terrible. It made me want to leave but I did not want to ruin everyone else fun so I take a deep breath and keep playing. Unfortuanately, my friend next to me kept mocking and trashtalking which, I guess it is kinda normal but instantly get on my nerve. It made me throw cards in my hand away and walked out of the table. I felt sorry and apologize them almost instantly but the damage is done. I ruined everyone else fun because I keep playing instead of leaving which will ruin everyone else fun as well. 

Now, it got into my list of the game I am not going to touch again.

It happened like 3-4 times already. I keep stay away from this kind of game but when I accidently get to play them I will get infruriating real bad. Don't want it to happen again. What to do!?",0.108,0.681,0.211,0.9787,0.9787

Then, one person attacks an opponent with hardly anyone in her capital and starts endgame and wins easily. We spent over an bour to build armies without even having incentive to attack anyone. I didnt find any reason to build an air or sea vessel when you can just walk across the dotted line over the sea to someones island. I felt like this game was just Explore.... with no expansion or real incentive to attack or take over someones island. Air and sea vessels didnt seem important at all. We didnt play wrong based on the rules but after all the work it just puttered out and didnt have any combat besides the one player attacking and defeating the other. Is there any reason to attack early or use vehicles? Cant you just turtle up and recruit people until the game ends? Needing some assistance because this was super underwhelming.

674,t3_ca7btu,The Quest for the Fountain of Youth,11,"With the help of some super fantastic artists I've been building the board game The Quest for the Fountain of Youth. We just finished alpha testing the game and are going to be redoing the map completely but I was hoping for some constructive criticism, feedback, and honestly some real discussion about why the game might be fun and why it might not be fun. 

&amp;#x200B;

The main goal of the game is to get to the Fountain of Youth. To do so you must collect treasure as you round the game board which consists of 5 different regions (Ocean, Tundra, Desert, Jungle, Skies). Through out the map there are merchants. Once you collect enough treasure you stop at a merchant and purchase an ancient relic. There are 5 of these relics and you must have all of them to reach the fountain of youth and win the game. Each of these relics is region matched and can only be purchased at it's region's merchant. Once you've collected all of the relics you must be the first to the Fountain of Youth, following one of 5 river paths that separate the regions up to the Fountain itself which is in the middle of the board. 

Also purchasable at merchants are Merchant cards. You may only purchase one merchant card per turn and may only hold 3 at a time. These can give you a significant advantage during the game, such as stealing another players relic, teleporting around the board, etc. You cannot use a Merchant Card the same round you purchase it. 

A normal roll would be rolling a D6, moving the number of spaces, drawing a Field Card which is how you collect or lose treasure. These cards can be Gain 1, 2, 3, Lose 1, 2, 3, Lose a Turn, Gain an extra turn, go back two spaces. If you land on a merchant before your dice roll is up you continue moving after you're done purchasing. This is where things can get a little spicy.

Field cards not only effect the person who drew them, but who ever is in the region the card is based. The Field card deck consists of 50 card, 10 for each region. 

After the effect of your Field Card is complete it is discarded and your turn is over. 

I'm sure there are things I'm forgetting to detail in here, but this is the jist of the game. Does this sound like something that would strike your guys interest or is it just a rebrand of something I haven't played? Really hoping not. Thanks guys!",0.068,0.794,0.138,0.9858,10.8438

My turn began with placing 30 troops, I said “I would like to place my troops on Argentina” and placed them there. I then decided to attack my friend in Brazil and we rolled and I won. However, we realized that I was actually attacking myself and we didn’t realize because I had used another color pieces to sub in for my own because I had ran out of my own pieces. Once I realized that I attacked myself (Although my friend had rolled for my “other army”) I decided I wanted to change my 30 pieces starting position from Argentina to a Brazil (to attack Africa)

My friends immediately said it wouldnt be fair because I had already placed my troops and exclaimed (“I want to place my troops on Argentina”) however, the rules state you can only place troops at the beginning of your turn (before you attack) but says nothing about moving them multiple times before you’ve begun your turn. Obviously I had “begun” my turn but I hadn’t attacked a (real) person (so I wouldn’t count that as real gameplay).

690,t3_ca4cgn,What does the number of 10's outside your top 10 say about you?,7,"I have a friend who rates many games as a 10. They tell me that they have a positive outlook on games. I believe that is probably true knowing the person and his collection.

&amp;#x200B;

But the amount of 10's you have rated could mean a number of things. Is it an indication of playing a lot of games? Is it an indication of favorable first impressions and then not adjusting those ratings? Might you rate games that you have backed as 10's? Maybe you don't believe there are any perfect games out there, therefore you don't have any 10's. Or maybe you have the average number of 10's in your collection.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to propose a benchmark: I am guessing that most people have enough games rated a 10 to fill out there top 10. To that end I would like people to comment with how many 10's they have rated beyond their top 10 games; mine would be a -1 as I have 9 games rated as a 10. Then also give their best guess as to why they are not near a zero; for me I believe I am in the average, but I am probably wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Suggested format:

**-1**I believe I am in the average.  I own about 200 games so that would put my 10's at about 5% of the games I own.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: It appears most people are stingy with their 10's. I haven't seen one person in the positive numbers no matter the number of games rated. I think optimist and pessimists alike value their 10's and reserve them for games that really speak to them.",0.047,0.806,0.147,0.9538,6.6766

692,t3_ca0wt5,Played 1st game of GoT Board Game with MoD expansion,19,"Last night, 4 of us played GoT board game with Mother of Dragon expansion. We were all new to the game from from the time we arrived to finish, it took us 8 hours. 
We did not include Essos, Targaryen or Iron Bank but included Vassals, new Sea orders and ability to trade Power Tokens, Arryn and overlay tiles. Based on a threat from OP, we picked Dorne, Arryn, GJ and Tyrell as our houses. We had 3 vassals - Lannister, Start and Bar.
We enjoyed it overall but we found it very frustrating. I was Arryn and the Dorne player starts with Iron Throne and Raven ...
The Influence track didn’t get reschuffled until turn 9!!! Which means that for 8 turns, I was without a vassal ... it was horrible ... 
The supply track also didn’t get updated until turn 6 or 7 .... very frustrating since I was on 1 or 2 from the start. 
A lot of it is bad luck from the Westeros cards and also the fact that Dorne had both IT and Raven, he was able to avoid these trackers to be updated.
As I mentioned, we enjoyed it but for 8 hours, it was frustrating ... a lot of back and forth without anything much happening. Not having a vassal for 8 turns when everyone else had one was ridiculous. I was boxed in a lot. I got up to 6VP on turn 9 but Dorne won with 7 VP on turn 10.
I guess we’ll try with Targaryen next time and I guess should try to up to 6 players but I am not looking forward to another 8 hours ...
I also was not a fan of tide of battle cards ... didn’t need that randomness. Two of the other guys liked it. You guys like them? Did we pick the right houses?",0.119,0.778,0.103,-0.7542,-14.329799999999999

&amp;#x200B;

*How long have you been playing:*

I've been in hobby boardgames for about 5 years now, it started out with lighter stuff, Ticket to Ride, Splendor, King of Tokyo etc... Now I vastly prefer heavy, Euro games but will still play almost anything at least once. Prior to hobby boardgames I did a good amount of D&amp;D, about 20 years of MTG and then the classic midwestern upbringing of playing cards, Euchre, Hearts etc...

&amp;#x200B;

*Organization:*

My storage is more or less organized by weight (heavier games on top) and then box size but I don't really put too much thought into it.

&amp;#x200B;

*Favorite games I own:*

If I had to pick my current 5 favorite games that I own it would be (no particular order): Lisboa, Brass Birmingham, Food Chain Magnate, Great Western Trail, and Gaia Project.

&amp;#x200B;

*Games I dislike:*

I do a pretty good job of curating my collection and getting rid of games that are no longer to my tastes or that I've outgrown, for example I no longer have the classic gateway games of Catan, Ticket to Ride etc.. I also keep a decent amount that even though I don't care for much, they are good games to play with my kids who are still young like, King of Tokyo, Castle Panic, Splendor.

&amp;#x200B;

*Wishlist:*

I backed the new Age of Steam kickstarter as well as the Irish Gauge preorder so I am pretty excited about both of those coming in. I was just at Origins and I'm kind of kicking myself for not picking up Pipeline, but I was unsure about it and didn't really get an opportunity to properly demo it. I also wouldn't mind picking up Vinhos, as I tend to like Lacerda games.

&amp;#x200B;

*Want to play:*

I haven't had the chance to get The Gallerist to the table yet and I've only played Escape Plan once, so both of those are pretty high on my want to play list. Pretty much any game on my top shelf though I would play in a second. I love Hansa Teutonica but for some reason have a really hard time selling people on it and getting it to the table, it is such a good game and I really want to play it at 5p. Same with Wildcatters, I love the game but it doesn't get out very often and when it does it is usually at 3p, the game really shines at 4p.

&amp;#x200B;

*What I like best about the hobby:*

Honestly just hanging out with friends and enjoying an activity together. I've been pretty blessed that my core group of friends for the past 20 years are all gamers and we still get together to play, I've also met some good friends through Meetup and we now meet outside of that. It is a great hobby and community, I like that as I approach middle age I can still learn new things frequently. When I was at Origins my group was getting ready to start a game of Terra Mystica and a random stranger, who was at least 60+ years old, came up and asked to join. I really love that about the hobby and if, 20 something years from now, I am still attending cons and am able to randomly join a game, I'll consider that  a pretty good life.",0.029,0.702,0.268,0.9995,38.9805

706,t3_cafcks,How to keep sleeved cards from sliding all over?,7,"Although I have a lot of board games that have some cards as components, I typically don't like card based games. The only game I've ever purchased sleeves for is Coup, and with Coup, just the 15 sleeved cards tend to slide out of the stack because of the smoothness of the sleeves.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, to my surprise, I fell in love with 2 deck building games at Origins Game Fair. One was Boss Monster 3, which we bought on the spot after playing a demo, and the other was Star Realms, which I bought after playing the digital version that I got a free code for at Origins.

&amp;#x200B;

Since these are games that are fully card based, I'm thinking about buying sleeves. But these games have lots and lots of cards, so I'm thinking about how much the small amount of Coup cards slide around and I can't imagine having a stack of 80 Star Realms sleeved cards.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know much about card sleeves, so are there certain better sleeves for games with large stacks? Are there sleeves that are not so smooth that don't slide around as much? Even if so, it seems like the additional thickness of the cards would make some of these larger decks enormous and make them teeter over easily.

How is that usually dealt with for larger decks like this?

*How long have you been playing:*

I've been more serious about building a collection for 5-6 years now. Played some games off and on with housemates for a while but really got into it around the time I got married. I grew up with the basic, luck-based board games of the 80's and I do still have a few of those in the collection.

*Organization:*

I have two Kallax 4x4 shelving cubes from IKEA. Games that fit in those cubes go in there and I usually try to fit similarly-sized boxes together. I like to have one heavy game on the bottom with a few lighter games stacked on top to maximize space without causing box damage. I also try to keep games and their expansions (when I'm actively using the expansion box) together. I also have a small plastic bin that has stuff like little card games and things like that on the bottom of the shelving unit, along with some expansion boxes I've kept for some reason.

Also, most of the stuff on the bottom shelf is stuff that I don't care about losing if the basement ever gets water in it. Games that are too big for the cubed shelving go on top.

*Favorite games I own:*

My current favorites would be:

* 7 Wonders
* Pandemic (in most of its iterations)
* Splendor
* Dominion (on top of the unit in the white cardboard box)
* Lanterns
* Alhambra

My wife and I discovered early on when dating (around 9 years ago, for reference) that we liked games, but we had the problem that usually one person was vastly better at a game than the other, which took some of the fun out of the game for us. Rather than let our shared hobby falter, I went on the hunt for a game we could both enjoy and remembered being briefly introduced to a game called Pandemic. I went out and found a copy. I taught the game to her and we were instantly hooked as she was thrilled with the idea that co-operative games actually existed. We've easily played Pandemic over a thousand times, starting from the original box (not stored on the shelf but instead off in general storage as we played that board and those cards to near death) up through most of its current themes. We typically play the game with open-hand and with each person controlling two characters (we found 4 player setups to be the most enjoyable to us). I can safely say that Pandemic is one of ""our things"" and provided us a great forum to get to know each other.

*Games I dislike:*

We were given the Lord of the Rings themed games in the upper right that I don't particularly care for. I don't care much for Monopoly anymore, but as a kid, I loved the game and was given a fairly nice copy of it, so I keep it around.

*Wishlist:*

I like games like Ascension and Race for the Galaxy, but my wife hates them, so I haven't been willing to pull the trigger on them since my friends who like those games play them. I'd like to finish off our Zombies collection ad my wife and I enjoy that game and, after moving, now have sufficient space to properly play it. I also know there is an expansion for Pandemic: the Cure that I need to get my hands on.

*Want to play:*

We haven't gotten 7 Wonders: Duel or Pandemic Legacy: Season 2 (NO SPOILERS) to the table yet as my wife needed a break from gaming for a while. Terra Mystica is another one I haven't yet gotten to the table. Dominion is also a game I want to play more but can be hard for me to get to the table.

*Unique Items:*

The Monopoly version I own is the 60th-anniversary version and it has a bunch of nice pieces, a sleek board, and a well-designed tray. It was definitely a triple-digit purchase my family made when I was a kid back in the early 90's, so I like to keep it around as a reminder of my family supporting me in a hobby they didn't care much for.

My wife brought a few unique games to the collection. She was born in the USA but has direct family in Germany, so she's acquired a few German games. 

*What I like best about the hobby:*

I like getting people together and just having a good time playing games, be it a co-op game or a highly competitive game. Fortunately, my group is a good mix of both types of gamers, so we get to a wide variety of games.",0.028,0.768,0.204,0.9994,25.984399999999997

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward from the previous article all the way to now. Using the design pattern from the designer/developers as well as a TON of play-testing, here is the current state of [Shifting Desert’s Gaping Maw](https://imgur.com/a/ctU3DUf).

As you can see, a lot has changed. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how things got to the point that they are now:

&amp;#x200B;

**Special Rules (Part 2):**

Obviously I removed the Special Rule about Gathering whenever I placed a Presence. It was definitely too much and needed to go.

As suggested by another user over on the Spirit Island subreddit (credit: /u/desocupad0 ), I shifted directions a bit with the design. It was stated that even though the Spirit was thematically based on devouring and gathering, I was dealing Damage with my Innate Power rather than simply using the Destroy keyword. Similar “desert” cards (such as Drought) simply Destroy large amounts of buildings, but add Blight. I decided to embrace this idea and build the Spirit around these mechanics. As a result, Blight does not cascade where Shifting Desert has a Sacred Site.

I also revised the conversion of Energy to Sun as well. As much as I wanted it to work, I found that in that iteration of the Spirit I was always spending Energy to reach thresholds and ended up being starved the entire game. It didn’t feel good, so I abandoned the idea of wanting to hit ten Sun Elements in one Innate Power. Instead, the current Special Rule simply adds a Sun (max of 2) where you have Sacred Sites. So as long as you have 2 (which shouldn’t be hard for Shifting Desert) you’ll be able to reach a lot of your thresholds. The limit is two so that it's balanced around the solo game and doesn't get out of control with more players.

&amp;#x200B;

**Innate Powers (Part 3):**

*The Ravenous Hunger Devours*

This Power revealed time and time again that it was too hard to hit the later Elemental thresholds even late into the game, that was a problem. It's still something that I'm working with, but it will get there in time. It was decided that Shifting Desert was primarily a Spirit of the Sun rather than Earth, so that shifted things around a bit. One iteration of the Innate Power had an extra threshold on the ability to add one extra range. It came from the fact that Shifting Desert couldn't deal with Cities that aren’t built in the Sands. It felt as though I was trying to make it plausible to deal with everything when that's not what balance means. So I offloaded some of that power into one of the Unique Power Cards and that allowed me to remove it from this Innate Power. I also changed the Damage the Innate Power was doing simply because twelve was definitely too much, and we couldn’t ever get that much health into a Sands location in any of our play-tests either. As was mentioned previously, it was brought to my attention that most desert-based Powers simply destroy buildings and don't worry about Damage values. So I modified the Innate Power to work similarly.

*Mirage Leads to Certain Demise*

Yeah, it was really busted the iteration I showed off in third article as well. Repeating a Gather effect even once is really powerful. Gathering two Explorers really makes the game a cakewalk in the early game which leads to a nearly non-existent or non-threatening late game. The current version is easy to Gather one, but Gathering more than one takes effort and by that time it doesn't make the game trivial.

&amp;#x200B;

**Unique Powers (Part 4):**

*Scorch With Desert Heat*

Somehow I’m surprised that this one stayed relatively the same for the longest time in its purest form. It just felt good once I made it match how Flash Flood works for River Surges. With the mention of a theme change (Damage to Destroy) it didn't take much to modify this Power. It allows for some good choices, it's an effective Power assuming you don't use it terribly and destroy lots of Dahan with it. Really liking how this one feels.

*Revitalizing Oasis*

I wanted a way for Desert to deal with adding the Blight that it did, so this was the solution. It has a use outside of clearing out Blight and it feels good to use. I like the conditional having two Dahan so that the Blight removal isn't free. For now it's in a good place.

*Bury In Tombs Of Sand*

This Power allows for some flexibility when wanting to Destroy just one Town or being and to deal with them just outside of your range.

*Blinding Sandstorms*

A defensive Power. There's not too much going on here. It incentivizes placing lots of Presence in the same location. I like how it feels, I'll probably need to tweak the numbers a little more since it feels like it Defends just a bit too much sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Growth Options (Part 5)**

Things changed a bit here. I went looking at River Surges and Thunderspeaker for guidance, since they seemed (to me) to be Spirits of the Sun as well. After taking a break from Shifting Desert and playing a few games of River, I learned that I really liked how it could place two Presence with one option, but you could only do it if you were fine everywhere else. I also took an idea from River where it only gained Energy by using the Reclaim All option.

I took the Reclaim One option from River and Thunderspeaker and put it into Shifting Desert’s Presence Tracks as well. It doesn't feel as mandatory as it does when playing River, but it's still a good spike in Power.

One of the biggest things that I learned while making Desert is that Presence Tracks are a lot harder to balance and figure out than I had originally thought. Several iterations had lots of Elements in them and some of them ramped up too quickly. Now that I had a double place Presence option, the Presence Tracks needed to be weaker. I'm still messing around with the Energy gain, but it feels good at the moment. Turns out most of the power in the Spirit and how it fares in each state of the game is largely determined by how it's Presence Tracks are set up.

&amp;#x200B;

**Structural Testing (Part 6)**

Does it work? Yes, yes it does.

&amp;#x200B;

**Coherence Testing (Part 7)**

Do all the pieces contribute?

I found this part of play-testing to be the hardest. I found that during several iterations of the Unique Power Cards there were too many times where I just wanted to Reclaim my hand and play the same two Powers over and over again. Other times I would never use one of the Unique Power Cards and simply save it as forget-fodder for Major Powers later. Both of these are signs that the coherence of the Spirit is off and that something needs to be changed.

In its current form, I use all of the Unique Power Cards fairly equally and I know the Coherence Testing portion of the design is a lot better than before due to a specific scenario that occurred a few times during testing. I had forgotten one of my Unique Power Cards in order to acquire a Major Power and then ON THE VERY NEXT TURN I looked in my hand and wondered where that Unique Power Card had gone because the board suddenly had a great way for it to be played. I looked for it in my hand and realized with horror that I had just forgotten it. It made me smile when I realized that each of the Unique Power Cards had their place. It wasn’t just one Unique Power Card either, this has happened with three of the four.

&amp;#x200B;

**Balance Testing (Part 8)**

Is the power level appropriate?

I think so. It doesn’t invalidate the early game and struggles with larger clumps of Invaders in the late game. It can play for Major Powers if it has to, but it isn’t a sustainable way to play the Spirit for more than a turn.

Here’s the best part (for me, at least), I kept track of all my revisions throughout the process and it's been amazing to watch how certain events caused a shift in ideologies and designs.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for a few miscellaneous tips and things from the designer/developers (just in case you haven’t heard them before). These aren't in a coherent order, just a smattering of some thoughts that helped my process a lot:

&amp;#x200B;

Ted:

&gt;Unique Powers don't necessarily cost the same as Minor Powers (some cost 2 or 3) but they use the same costing formula. Every effect has an associated energy value, and the cost of a Minor Power reflects that value. 1 card play is also a cost, worth (IIRC) about 2 energy. So a Minor Power that costs 0 has an effect worth about 2 energy, and a Minor Power that costs 1 has an effect worth about 3 energy. Unique Powers use the same costing formula, so a unique power that costs 2 will have a 4 energy effect, etc. A Unique Power that costs 0-1 should have the same power level as a Minor Power with the same cost.  
&gt;  
&gt;“A lot of this centers around the Element Pie (Spirit Island's take on MtG's color pie). Basically which effects belong to which elements. For example, Sun is the element of command, so many effects which move Dahan have Sun. Moon is the element of change and transformation. Earth is about consistency and repetition, so the earth spirits tend to have a relatively stronger ""reclaim all"" growth option. Air is the opposite-- air spirits have a weaker reclaim all.  
&gt;  
&gt;And of course there's other stuff not affiliated with elements that range from good guidelines to hard rules. For example, Spirits can never destroy Dahan for a resource gain. They can only destroy Dahan as collateral damage. That's a hard rule. Cities can never be moved-- that's just a guideline, which a few major powers can break. But you need a really good reason to break it.

&amp;#x200B;

Leif:

&gt;Major Powers, on the other hand, get a discount (I don't recall how much) to account for the cost of forgetting a power. So a Major Power that costs 2 will be more powerful than a Unique Power that costs 2.  
&gt;  
&gt;A low complexity spirit may never have elements on its presence tracks.

&amp;#x200B;

Dylan:

&gt;Some tidbits to bear in mind:  
&gt;  
&gt;\* Elements have value. To fine-tune the cost of a card, add or subtract elements.  
&gt;  
&gt;\* Card plays have value. A 0-cost card provides benefit, because you're giving up something to play the card.  
&gt;  
&gt;\* Targeting restrictions lower the cost of a card.  
&gt;  
&gt;\* Unique powers need to be costed the same way as other powers, or it warps the game in undesirable way.  
&gt;  
&gt;\* Major Powers are costed approximately as if you never hit the threshold. The extra benefit of sometimes hitting the threshold cancels the cost of having to forget a card.

&amp;#x200B;

Eric:

&gt;I have an extremely crufty spreadsheet for Power Card costing. It's very much a starting-point, **not** an end-all-and-be-all - it comes in spot-on for fairly vanilla Minor Powers, but multi-part effects can have internal synergies/anti-synergies, and uncommon effects don't necessarily have a pinned-down cost. (Or I have a cost but know it's not quite right.) Also, some modifiers (eg: Fast, Range, terrain restrictions) are really more multipliers than flat adds/subtracts - I have flat adds/subtracts that I use for low-cost Powers, but need to scale them up when dealing with higher costs.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Growth costing is more recent, and is in Ted's + my heads.  
&gt;  
&gt;Uniques are usually costed exactly as per Minors, but:  
&gt;  
&gt;(a) This is deceptive, because when you add/remove an element from a Unique Power Card you know \*exactly\* how awesome/terrible it is for the Spirit getting it based on what their innates need, whereas for a Minor Power it's just a probabilistic minor nudge to the costing;  
&gt;  
&gt;(b) Unique Power Cards \*can\* vary off of normal costing if need be, but doing so by too much creates often-undesirable dynamics. If you overcost/underpower the Unique Power, it becomes Forget-fodder for a Major Power (or perhaps Choice Event). If you undercost/overpower it, it makes Reclaim effects more valuable, and can over-synergize with things that allow Repeats - e.g., if you made a Spirit that had a Unique Power that should cost 5-6 Energy but only cost 1, its game would probably focus around trying to flog that as much as possible.  
&gt;  
&gt;Major Powers do get a small boost just for being Majors, but not nearly enough to compensate for the loss of a Power Card (a Major Power that did the exact same thing as a Minor Power would cost about 2/3 of an Energy less). The opportunity for hitting threshold effects fills in the rest of that value. Earlier iterations had actual costing formulas for threshold effects - e.g., ""A 3-3-2 threshold should have an effect that's about N% of the value of the main effect"" - but eventually I was going more on play experience than numbers and just stopped updating the model.  
&gt;  
&gt;The concept of ""element pie"" is much looser in Spirit Island than in M:tG. The same effect might provide / require radically different elements depending on *how* it's being enacted. But there are definitely trends.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ted's list is pretty much spot-on for development, and nicely captures layers of importance / ripple-effects. It doesn't cover the way I initially come up with designs, though, which tends to be more of a ping-pong iteration between theme and mechanics, using each to brainstorm on / flesh out the other.  
&gt;  
&gt;Whatever the guide, one step - or perhaps a follow-on to every step - is going to be ""iterate a lot"". :-)

And with that, I bid you all adieu. It’s been quite the adventure and hopefully someone was able to glean from my choices and mistakes. I love talking about the design process of creating Spirits for this wonderful game.

My TL;DR for this entire journey is summarized by the title of this final article. No matter what you do, or how much research you put into your own Spirit, you need to iterate upon the idea. Make small changes and put it through the testing cycle again. Keep doing it until you’re happy where it is. It could take one iteration, it could take dozens, or even hundreds (as I’m sure the official Spirits do/did).

You’ve all heard enough from me these past few weeks. If you have any questions about anything in this regard, I would love to talk about them. Until next time, I’ll be working on Vicious Thorns Lash Out In Anger and Swampy Swamp Swamps a Swampy Swamp (because names are hard).",0.045,0.807,0.148,0.9998,34.993

It was a small travel strategy game from a really small developer (I think it was a married couple who had a couple small time games). It had a foam rolling mat with a hexagonal board layout printed on the mat. There were 5 gems per person, and you placed them in the to try and block your opponent.

727,t3_cagsle,The best gaming experience of my life.,58,"My wife recently surprised me with a copy of Twilight Imperium Forth Edition. The price tag and the game length are what held me back, but my wife bought it for me anyways. Tonight we played our first game, a 4 player game. We played for 13 hours including set up, learning, and eating breaks. We had to end early though, and finished with my wife and I tied at 8 points, but one of us would have won next round.

I can say without hesitation or doubt, this was the greatest gaming experience I have ever had. Everything about this game was firing on all cylinders, it's worth every penny. It will outshine all your other boardgames, so buy it now and save yourself some money, or buy it later after you've bought other games you won't play after twilight imperium. 

Player interaction is where Twilight Imperium out shines other games. You are forced to expand if you want to gain victory points and grow your army. As the board gets crowded, and armies get larger, simply moveing one space over, or building a new fleet can generate debate and discussion. Also, after each round you cast votes for or against new rules, or elect players or planets to recieve good or bad conditions. This voting creates heated debates and bartering.

Combat is very exciting, and your success is balanced between luck and strategy. Have you upgraded your ships enough before hand? Do you have secret action cards to destroy your opponents fleet, or nullify their attacks? You decide which ships of yours get destroyed in combat, which is where strategy comes in. After the battle in outer space is complete, the next step is invading the planet below. Bombardment from ships, space cannons, and infantry all play a part in this phase. 

The Lore, and 17 playable races, all make for an immersive experience. Reading the introduction pulls you in to make you feel like your really part of this galactic battle. And reading your races Lore makes you feel connected in some way. 

I wish I made the plunge earlier, because this game is it. It trumps all other war/strategy game Imo. Maybe games like Scythe and Rising don't take as long to play, but it's so worth it to invest the time and money into Twilight Imperium instead. You will not be disappointed.",0.096,0.737,0.168,0.9875,57.275000000000006
728,t3_cal027,I FINALLY beat my friends at Citadels,13,"So I bought **Citadels** about a year and a half ago, and it became pretty much an instant hit among my friends. Within a week, we had probably played 10 or more times, and we even got a couple of my “non gaming” friends to join in.

The issue with new games among my circle of friends is that there’s one guy who is just *better* than everyone else. He claims that he doesn’t really develop much of a strategy the first time he plays a game, but he still manages to win, even if I’ve played before and he hasn’t. (Sidenote: it took me 15 plays of **Carcassonne** 1v1 against him to finally beat him.) This is somewhat beside the main point, but in those first 10 plays or whatever, he probably won at least half. The remaining half was split up among another 2 or 3 friends.

That left me with 0 wins in over 10 plays, and hell, I owned the game. I own most of the games we play. But on a glorious night last week, I played Citadels with him and another friend (one of the others who has actually won before), and while the start looked a little bit rocky, I *finally*, for the first time ever, beat my friends at Citadels.

So, I made this: https://imgur.com/gallery/cOangGt

It’s not especially more useful during play than just having some stacks around the board, but it *is* a solid little piece that provides more protection for the blocks than a thin bag.

Person A for slapping a card that is not a Jack or Person B for not paying attention and prematurely tossing a card on top of a Jack in play?

Person B is adamant she wins because Person A slapped a non Jack.  

Person A says the whole crux of the game is to be quick on your toes to slap a Jack.  If you toss down your card too quickly and didn’t notice there was a jack in play, you lose in the same manner if you flinch and hit a King because you thought it was a Jack.   The game is called Slap Jack, not Throw Down Your Card As Fast As You Can.

My biggest issue, the same as everyone’s, was the top. The material wasn’t that bad and the imagery was actually ok for poker, but I mainly play games and just didn’t want it. I reupholstered with black 3mm neoprene. It was fairly simple except I couldn’t wrap it. I took the railing off, cut to size, stapled the neoprene down overtop the original felt.

739,t3_cawjev,DISCUSSION: Board games on the whole are designed 30 minutes too long.,0,"I am not going to rant and rave about this but I will explain more in comments as I see others views but the abstract to this debate is:

Generally, media such as films and TV has been getting longer and longer over the last few years. Netflix has turned 3 hour series into 12 hour series. Board games have been subsumed. Almost every game I play, the change that happens throughout the game is too slow or stagnates in the middle. Root has a part just after the initial expansion where everyone builds up and no-one does much. Games with rounds often go for 8 when it should have been 6.

Games tend to edge on the well that didn’t feel too long when it was okay when I feel we would be okay with tight game experiences that almost feel like you get your hands chopped off. Length does not equal depth.

EDIT: I have no problem with long games. My facourite game is Spirit Island which is long and hefty but the game is dynamic and uses the time to craft an experience that I can’t imagine in a shorter timeframe. A game like teotihuacan, a well crafted game with mid to high mid euro level depth and looks good, takes 2 and a half to 3 hours for an experience that to me feels like it should take an hour and a half.

745,t3_cax2t5,[LOST] Left backpack filled with board games on Melbourne train,18,"On Sunday night I left my backpack on the train when I hopped off.  After contacting the station master I was told no backpack showed up at the end of the line when the train was cleaned - someone picked it up.

- Cash n Guns
- Bang! The Dice Game
- A Fake Artist Goes to New York

751,t3_catw3k,Game mechanics that allow the number of players to increase over time,21,"In typical games, N players start the game and N – X players are still playing at the time the game ends. In chess and checkers N = 2 and X = 0. Both players are involved until the game is complete. In other games, X &gt; 0, and one or more players will exit the game before the game is completed. Monopoly, Risk, Diplomacy, and many other games are exemplars of this type. 

The rise of cooperative games means that there are quite a few options for gamers who don’t want any players eliminated before the game is complete. The thing is, however, that A) some gamers some of the time want to play games in which one or more players are eliminated before the game ends and B) there is a social downside to those types of games: being eliminated early means a player has nothing to do while the rest of the group continue to play. This can be particularly unpleasant if a person is eliminated several hours before the game ends. Most people join a game group to play games, not to simply watch others play games.

So what I am wondering, has anyone created a card or board game in which 1 or 2 players start the game, and the game allows additional players to continually join over time? The type of game I envision might start with one or two players, and then additional players could enter at any time mid-game, and remain until the end. Such a game would be particularly useful in a situation in which a bunch of friends start Game A, in which players are eliminated one after the other (e.g. Diplomacy). In this situation, as each gamer is eliminated from Game A, s/he could join Game B. This allows every person (even those eliminated from Game A) to be an active player for an entire evening of gaming. 

There is one other situation that a game that supports an increasing number of players might address: the situation in which you know that several members of your group will arrive on time, but several others will show up late.

I should say that I am super new to gaming in general (and this sub in particular), so my apologies if this question has been addressed before, or if there is a super well-known example of a game that allows gamers to continually join the action.",0.013,0.887,0.1,0.9794,20.5674
752,t3_cau406,A Case for Charterstone,23,"Disclaimer: I'm not super involved in the meta of this sub, so sorry if this breaks a rule for posting content that I'm not aware of. Just let me know.

I heard a lot of mixed reviews on this sub about Charterstone before I bought it. Most of them were either negative or *bleh*. I've now played 10 of 12 sessions, and wanted to talk about why I think it is a super unique experience.

One fo the things I love about games is the excitement of a playing a new one. I think a lot of people share this: we play many games because we love the puzzle, and a new game is a new puzzle to solve. Charterstone, by unlocking new spots on the board locations, workers, and development cards, makes a new puzzle everytime you play. On top of this, the guideposts provide a new goal (and often a game altering, one-time special rule) which changes the puzzle regardless of the changes on the board. I know there are plenty of games that change the subset of cards we play with or the win conditions, offering ""infinite"" replayability. However, even though it is hard to explain why, Charterstone feels different. Maybe that's because Charterstone is always moving forward, subtracting and adding, insted of recombining the same mechanics. To put it abstractly, Charterstone's progress feels linear, while other games with a constantly-changing puzzle feel circular.

I also know that other Legacy games might offer something similar, but it seems that Charterstone's focus on being a Euro-game first puts the puzzle at the forefront, while most other legacy games to-date are plot-driven. I really hope there are other eurolegacy games in development, even though ti seems like the legacy craze has died down a bit.

This game isn't perfect of course, and I think this is its biggest flaw: I think it would be pretty hard to find 6 people in the same group who all loved this game, and I also can't imagine playing it without 6 people (there are rules for automated players that just wouldn't be the same). In my family 2 people love it, 2 like it, and 2 can't wait for it to be over.

The other biggest flaw is that in terms of scoring points and winning, I think the scoring incentivizes you to find a simple boring engine and hold on to it for dear life, instead of welcoming the changes and trying new strategies. That's why my wife was really bored with the game, despite winning half of the rounds. 

I got charterstone for 29.99 around October last year. When it gets down to that price, I highly recommend picking up a copy if you at all think you'd be interested. As much as I enjoyed it, I would've been happy paying retail price for it ($70/12 sessions = $8ish per night, divided by 6 people = $1.50 per person per night).",0.052,0.783,0.164,0.9955,22.8965

755,t3_cazg1z,Has Trickerion replaced Pret-a-Porter?,3,"I was enthusiastic about new edition of Pret-a-Porter coming to Kickstarter that I didn't play years ago when it was available. But new art looked beautiful and with Kickstarter launching, I looked more into it. 

And now that I've watched videos and rules, including old videos by Rahdo and Tom Vasel, I can't get over the fact that Pret-a-Porter is something that Trickerion has (unintentionally I suppose) already done better?

In Trickerion you gather resources, hire special workers and prepare tricks for a show that happens few times every game and both have strong worker placement elements. But in Trickerion everything seems more dynamic, your workers have plenty of more layers both on your board and on the table, worker placement board has a better interactive arc and resource costs over what is valuable at any point of time in the game and the magic show puzzle (where multiple magicians can participate in the same show) is more climactic. Also the tricks are more interesting to prepare for and combine and compete over. 

So is Trickerion a heavier Pret-a-Porter? Or does Pret-a-Porter do something better than Trickerion does? In this era of one-in-one-out it's hard to justify a more mainstream version of Trickerion - even though art of Pret-a-Porter is very unique.",0.029,0.833,0.139,0.9796,2.9388

The liquor once took up the whole cupboard on the right, then the entire middle section. At this rate, I'm going to have to move the booze out to the garage!

We started out with a trip to our city's first boardgame cafe about two years ago. From there we bought **Pandemic** and introduced a few friends to the game. From there things snowballed. Both myself and my wife have been buying games like mad. 

The only thing I'd change about my collection would be less **Mansions of Madness**. Though my wife is enamoured with that game, I am not overly fond of it. I think because I always get saddled with the ""game master"" responsibilities.

765,t3_cavene,The Overshrinking of Game Boxes,6,"How is it that game designers (I'm particularly looking at you, kickstarter games) can't figure out that a lot of people like to sleeve their cards and adjust their box sizes accordingly. The sizes of the boxes I'm finding with modern games make no sense. They're slightly bigger than they need to be for simply holding what comes in them, but they're not big enough to hold sleeved cards? I understand that a lot of these campaigns make minimal (or no) profit, and they're trying to keep shipping costs down as much as they are trying to eliminate wasted box space, but games like Crypt, Unbroken, and Bargain Quest are all going to be sitting on my shelf with the lid awkwardly lifted an inch high. It seems like a tiny bit more planning could go into this stuff. I know that Unbroken even changed the sizes of some of the cards to fit in regular sleeves, because so many people wanted to sleeve it. Does this bother anyone else? Are there any game designers out there who can explain or defend why this is the case?

EDIT: Wow, this got a lot of great responses. After reading all y'all's comments, I should clarify a couple things:

1. For the purposes of this thread, I was just talking about overall box size, not the inserts. I'm pretty content to replace, adjust, or throw out my inserts now; as a couple of you pointed out, most are only there for shipping purposes. It's when stuff still doesn't fit that it starts to bother me.
2. I do sleeve cards that some of you have pointed out could go unsleeved - I like the feel of handling sleeved cards more, and I like protecting even non-shuffled, non-frequently-handled cards from accidental damage.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, it seems like the discussion boils down to a few points:

&amp;#x200B;

1. It looks like sleeving (at least complete sleeving) is less common that I assumed it to be. Maybe this isn't something that is on players' or designers' minds as much.
2. Someone mentioned that this is not a choice made by the designer, but by the publisher. That doesn't change my overall argument, but it definitely changes where I should have been directing it - thank you for clarifying this for me.
3. It sounds like cost and lack of necessity are the main forces at play. I suppose that's understandable, but I wish it would at least be a stretch goal on some projects or something... I would rather have slightly bigger box sizes than a special UV printed cover. Designers and publishers already try to cater to what players want - maybe there just isn't enough player interest in this yet for it to be important.",0.061,0.795,0.144,0.9918,5.9508

*How long have you been involved in the hobby?*

Since 2012. Due to extenuating life circumstances, I wound up taking care of my Mom full-time as she had developed dementia.  During that time, I stumbled across Wil Wheaton's TableTop Youtube show, and acquiring board games turned into a reward mechanism for me to cope with the situation I was in.  So down the rabbit hole I went.  About all of my games have been opened, punched out, but never played, since I really couldn't go out and make friends and have them over. I finally got back on my feet in 2017 and I joined a board game group earlier this year, and am finally culling my collection, getting rid of all the wheat, so I'm left with all the chaff. (Points if you get that reference)

*What would you change about your collection if you could?*

Oh man. So many things.  I wouldn't have gone nuts in the beginning, buying everything that looked appealing.  I'd also try to talk my former self off the ledge whenever I reasoned I could save $6 in shipping if I order another $50 worth of games.

*What is your favorite type of game?*

I love games that give me a story to tell afterwards.  Games like Burgle Bros., Robinson Crusoe, SW Outer Rim, Eldritch Horror, etc.

*What latest games have you bought?*

Wingspan, SW Outer Rim, and I have Century: Golem edition in the mail.  
  
*Anything leaving your collection soon?*

Castle Panic will be getting replaced by Carnival Zombie once the Kickstarter comes in; same with Suburbia, as I ordered the new KS edition.  I'm also getting rid of Qwirkle at some point.

787,t3_caykan,Rising Sun or Root ?,19,"Hey everybody !

I wanna buy one of these games because they both look great, however I can't decide which one I should buy.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like Rising Sun is a much ""heavier"" game, much more serious. I love the minis and the diplomatia aspect. However, I think it is harder to find people to play it, because you need a minimum of 3 players and 2h30\~. Price is also quite high (90€ here in France) but considering the quality of minis, it is understandable.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, I really love the idea of asymetric races in Root (much more impactful than in Rising Sun imo), and the gameplay seems much funnier. Also, you can play it with only 2 players + bot, which is very convenient. However, the game is pretty expansive (75€ in france for the base game + extension included), considering the materiel which looks pretty cheap (only some wooden pieces and a board), and the design is weird (mix between Dont Starve Together / children cartoon look). Also, I'm worried about the balance between races..

Could you give me your point of view please ? Could be a good help !

&amp;#x200B;

Cut to 2010, we're playing Carcassonne and Ticket to Ride.

&amp;#x200B;

Cut to later in 2010, we think ""hey, maybe it's time to play Puerto Rico!""

&amp;#x200B;

We spend a day learning it and then play a 4 player game. It's so hard! What role do I choose? When does the game end, again? OMG so many buildings, which do I buy? DON'T CRAFTSMAN HE'LL GET 5 CORN! DID YOU BUILD THE FORTRESS I WANTED THE FORTRESS!

&amp;#x200B;

It took us HOURS.

&amp;#x200B;

It was too heavy for one of our friends but the rest of us liked the game a lot. It got played once or twice more with this group, and then hit the shelf for a long time. It was just too stressful of a game to bring out as much as TTR or Catan was.

&amp;#x200B;

Cut to 2011- 2019, most of those guys have moved away and the rest of us dive deep into board games. Dominion, Tzolk'in, Dominant Species. Twilight Struggle, all the Feld games, Cyclades, Kemet, Bohnanza, Eclipse, Dixit, Netrunner, Caylus, Codenames, it goes on and on (you know the drill). Puerto Rico got played once in 2016.

&amp;#x200B;

**And now...**

In case you didn't know, @gameylannister is a great dude on instagram trying to play the top 100 BGG games in 100 days. He needed to play Puerto Rico so we played a 3-player game over the weekend with my copy. We knocked it out in 90 minutes. I must be desensitized to ""heavy"" games now, or maybe games have gotten heavier over time, or maybe both, because PR felt like a challenging mid-weight game! This is particularly entertaining because of that game's history in my group of friends - as some crazy pie-in-the-sky game, and now just this medium ""let's have a beer in the afternoon"" game.

&amp;#x200B;

I know PR has fallen from favor due to its scripted opening and some balance issues, but it still provided a great challenge to us and meaningful decisions abound. I won 43-39-28 (don't remember the third score) and I don't know how good those scores are in terms of what's possible from the game. However, the other guys I was playing with are experienced gamers (just not with Puerto Rico) and had had no problem picking the game up immediately. Not overwhelmed by the choices or confused by any rules.

&amp;#x200B;

Just goes to show you how far the hobby has come.

793,t3_capmnx,Blood on the Clocktower Review,138,"After planning for a couple weeks, my friends and I finally played a print-and-play version of Blood on the Clocktower (BOTC) that I had put together. Given the hullabaloo about the SUSD review earlier this year, I figured I'd pitch in with my take on the game.
A bit of background: My friends and I have played social deduction games, but it is definitely not our favorite genre by any means. We used to play The Resistance and One Night Ultimate Werewolf somewhat regularly, but those games fell out of fashion. In particular, we soured on The Resistance because there simply wasn’t enough actual information in the game to make it ‘interesting’. We now mostly play medium-ish games, some favorites being Ginkopolis, Inis, Not Alone, Scythe, Terraforming Mars, and Spirit Island. I mostly wanted to try BOTC due to the SUSD review – the idea of having that wonderful big group experience while still having logical, tactical deduction instead of shouting matches sounded wonderful.


Most people had played Mafia or Werewolf before, so explaining the rules was fairly simple. On the first game, the good characters cautiously shared information, while the evil players generally kept quiet and offered tentative alibis. It was only when the supposed monk realized that they were drunk did everyone go ‘wait, what?’ and the game started to shine. From there, the lies and deceptions started to flow much more naturally. We played another game right after with me storytelling, and another game with a new storyteller right after that. The new storyteller was able to pick up the role without too much effort, and we had a brilliant game of second guessing ourselves with a baron in play.


After the initial 3 plays, we then played the game 5 times with almost the same group the next day. Everyone got much more comfortable with the different roles and at bluffing, although one person did get slightly flustered at being the imp three times in a row. But it was the last game that truly sold it for our group. The demon was about to be killed through a smart deception from the ravenkeeper, but the spy successfully planted the idea that a poisoner could be about. Her words caused the good team to frantically analyze any possibility of their previous assumptions being wrong. We wavered over which outsider was in play for 10 minutes. The supposed recluse almost burst a blood vessel after we spent so much time considering if there was a drunk. It finally ended when we finally decided on killing the demon, the good team collapsing in a group hug when the storyteller announced that good had triumphed. We spent the next 30 minutes exhilarated and exhausted, going over all the craziness that had happened. It was the kind of high that any player of a social deduction game dreams of.


It’s a bit hard to explain what feels different between BOTC and its older cousins, but I think the biggest change is the lack of player elimination. Everyone can be involved for the whole game, and everyone *wants* to be involved for the whole game because they have their own unique role. This also means that the whole group is wrapped up in the dramatic tension at the end of the game – no one except the storyteller knows exactly what is going on. The game length varied a bit, but in general they were about 30 minutes all included with 7 players. The quick game length was definitely a plus overall, since most people got to experience different parts of the game with their different roles.


Overall, this is definitely my #1 social deduction game now. I loved the way I was not only always questioning other players, but also myself. Whenever I had a hunch about another player lying, I could reason out how that hunch could affect the given scenario. Victories and losses both felt very earned. I can’t wait to make printouts of the ‘Bad Moon Rising’ and ‘Violets and Sects’ modules, and I highly recommend anyone on the fence to print out a copy, grab a group, and try it for yourself. I’ll end by saying that I have never backed a kickstarter game before – and I hope to never do so again – but this is one game I really want to share with everyone I know and play it more.",0.093,0.743,0.165,0.9958,137.4204
794,t3_cazjn5,Help with designing a one-shot mafia game?,8,"In a Chinese entertainment show called Keep Running, there was a variant mafia game with 10 people, where the mafia had to rip off a name-tag off the town people's backs in order to kill them. NOBODY knew what role the others were (even mafia didn't know who mafia were). The location was an empty old town, with clues interspersed throughout the area as to who the mafia were. The only way the town could kill mafia was by finding cards throughout the town on which they could write names, after then that person would instantly die. (Of course, mafia could use these cards too) 

Additionally, there was a shrine any number of people could walk into (3 in the ep), it would tell you if there was a majority of mafia in the shrine or not (green/red light). This shrine was the starting point of the game AND popped up two more times - in the middle, and to finish the game. 

The catch was that the players began the game with an intro along the lines of ""our elder died, but at least the three didn't manage to do anything else"" which made the players believe there were only 3 mafia, but it was actually a misleading statement nobody considered - there were actually only 3 town ; and it was CHAOS when people immediately betrayed their mafia status but ended up killing their own team off.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if the explanation was too long, but i wanted to convert this into a smaller scale variant to play with friends in a house setting - either by just adding rules to the normal game (w/ poker cards) sitting in a circle, or maybe something more exciting with clues around the house. Problem is I can't really think about how mafia killing should work?

&amp;#x200B;

## Day 6

What does an **offer** look like?

After I have obtained offers from various companies worldwide, I would like to show here how an offer is structured.

&amp;#x200B;

Excel seems to be the standard, even if it is sometimes converted into a PDF for mailing.

The indicated prices are mostly in dollars, so that I have converted these for comparison to European manufacturers.

&amp;#x200B;

There are different columns in the offer:

**Name**

This is the name of the component, which I had assigned during the inquiry.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dimensions**

The dimensions are either in millimeters or in inches. But always mentioned behind it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Printing Process**/**Color/Finish**

Here there is usually something like 4/4c. Means number of colors front side / number of colors back side. If it is colorful, there is always 4c there, with black strangely mostly 0c. But this means apparently ""no further printing"". In addition, there are other properties under Finish, such as ""rollable"", ""sealed in plastic bag"", ""hot stamping"".

&amp;#x200B;

**Quantity**

If, for example, 10 cubes are ordered and only differ in colour, then here is ""10"" and under colour the division.

&amp;#x200B;

**Material**/**Construction**/**Mould Charge**/**Film Charge**

This is the specification of what the material is made of or special features of the material. For example: CCNB - "" Clay coated news back board (CCNB) Recycled paperboard that is not bleached, has a white on 1 side that has been clay coated and the other side of the sheet is gray like a newspaper"". I found a good page that explains the abbreviations ([https://howtobuypackaging.com/packaging-industry-terminology/](https://howtobuypackaging.com/packaging-industry-terminology/)).

&amp;#x200B;

**Reference Image**

Often there is even an image in this column. Mostly my pictures, which I had sent along. Sometimes I had to be careful, because the dice were very similar, but those that the manufacturer still had in stock.

&amp;#x200B;

**Unit cost**

Typically, you can also see here which reference quantity this applies to (that is, 500 or 1000). If there are ""10 dice"" in the column, then the price is for ""10 dice"" and not just for one.

&amp;#x200B;

**Development cost**/**tooling cost**

I explained this yesterday with the dice. If a machine has to be set up for mass production or even parts have to be created for it, these are the costs. These are one-time setup costs.

&amp;#x200B;

At the bottom is the **total cost** of a game and the **total setup costs**. For example: 1 game costs 15 Euros in production and a total of 500 Euros in setup costs. If you break the setup costs down to the games, then the single game costs 16 Euro for 500 games and therefore all together 8.000 Euro.

&amp;#x200B;

There are also some special rows like **Assembly Cost** and **FOBNingbo**. But I'll explain tomorrow more about these and what the offer must cover about **CE** (European must have tests).

## Day 7

To continue my report from yesterday, I want to explain two more columns and what should be included in the offer about CE, testing and shipping.

&amp;#x200B;

**Assembly Cost**

My game consists of 11 different items (so the 10 wooden discs count as 1 item). These still have to be packed together and then the game has to be shrink-wrapped. All this costs time and material. With my inquiries this was always about 50 cents.

&amp;#x200B;

**FOBxxx**

There is always a harbour for xxx. FOB means Free On Board and is like CIF an international shipping agreement. FOB means as much as: We load the goods, but everything else is in your hands. That means transport, customs and further transport. (Detailed here: [https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/020215/what-difference-between-cif-and-fob.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/020215/what-difference-between-cif-and-fob.asp))

&amp;#x200B;

**Shipping Cost**

Ask about shipping cost, and if shipping, unloading and customs clearance are included.

&amp;#x200B;

**CE**

For Europe the offer should state that the goods are CE compliant. That way there is one less worry for you about the CE seal. There are very good webpages about CE.

## Day 8

Finally something to work on. I got the template for the playing cards today and am already busy filling them.

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed three terms:

**Margin** (Type)

Everything that is important to me should be within this innermost frame. Otherwise, shifts can cause it to be cut off.

&amp;#x200B;

**Trim**

This represents the real size of the playing cards.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bleed**

Up to this point the card must be filled up, because otherwise it can happen that something would remain unprinted due to shifts.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, I noticed with the first card that my cards have a different format.

I chose the 'Skat' format and the template was in a wider format.

Now I've written to the manufacturer to ask what effect this might have.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also attached a picture to give you an idea of what measure means what.

 * Strong symmetry - blues and reds equally want to hide their roles to the other team and share with their own. Compare to Resistance where the teams are unequal and one side must play very differently.
 * Even trades - for the most part you are sharing equal info with someone - it's a good move if they are on your side and it's a net-neutral move if they're not. So there isn't a strategic incentive to make moves (aside from speeding the game along)
 * Randomness and meta-gaming. It seems like a clear goal to get control and get President and Bomber in your room for the second-to-last round. But it felt like any configuration with President and Bomber separated is just 50/50 or relying on meta-gaming. Even if you have perfect information about all roles, you're just facing off with meta-strategies and hoping that the other room does not make a mirror move to ruin your plan.

Has anyone come up with home brew ways to improve the red vs blue strategy? I thought more asymmetry and forced information reveals could be beneficial for the game, for example reusing Resistance power cards or treating stuff like the Enforcer as an ability card to be used once per round.

The contents are complete (per staff and the listed contents), but there are no large followers. The sets I've played with in the past, per my memory, ALWAYS had large followers. From cursory research I've now done online, it looks like the large followers are from the Inns and Cathedrals edition. Am I wrong that the basic edition contained large followers at some point?

822,t3_cbpub8,Found this gem at Fort Boonesborough,5,"On our way home, my family visited  Fort Boonesborough in Kentucky.  I ran across this game after having watched a brief ""educational"" movie regarding the fort and its relationship to Daniel Boone and his interactions with the Native Americans.  The movie did not refer to them as Native Americans, so when I ran across this game and its cover image, my first thought was, ""I'm so glad I don't have to review this game.""

839,t3_cb2s9i,"Cooperative Deck Builders - The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly",689,"Most of my board game time in the past 10 years has been 2-player with my wife. Once we were introduced to Pandemic, co-op games have been our bread and butter. We'll mix in the occasional game of Terraforming Mars or Concordia, but co-op games seem to be the ideal game for many couples - and we fit that mold. We've had a lot of enjoyment lately playing co-op deck builders in particular, so I thought I'd share what we've learned so far. I'll talk about these games roughly from least to most favorite. There are a couple of games in this list that might not fit the definition exactly, but this is my post, so I'll do what I want.

First up is **Shadowrun: Crossfire** (10 plays). This game has the structure of a great deck builder, but fails in the execution. I really liked the theme - the mix of futuristic tech and magic was very cool (I understand there is a Shadowrun universe, but I know nothing about it). The game had some neat little elements - a campaign like structure where you can earn perks to make your character stronger, which allows you to attempt harder missions.

It's failings were critical for us, however. Lots of co-op games are swingy because of card draw, but S:C pretty much takes the cake. You can have insta-lose right away due to bad card draw, or you can feel good about yourself and then get massacred in one turn. I like my co-ops hard, but reasonably so - I don't want to have to grind out the same mission over and over to gain perks. It's a board game, not a video game.

*You might like this if*: you like losing a lot, you love the Shadowrun universe, insta-lose is your friend.

**Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle** (20 plays) is an interesting one. This game is the best bad game I've every played. As a family of Harry Potter fanatics, buying this game was a no-brainer, but my expectations were low. Once we got into it, we found numerous things that we loved, and just as many that we hated. Essentially, it is a great game that is fundamentally broken. You can read [my specific thoughts here](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8bqqyz/harry_potter_hogwarts_battle_is_the_best_bad_game/), but to sum up: 1. Poor player count scaling, 2. No categories/tiers of villains or cards, 3. The Spiral of Death.

But on the plus side, it's got some really good mechanics that incorporate everything you love from the Harry Potter universe. (If you're interested, here's a link to my [post about house rules for the game](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8bziei/harry_potter_hogwarts_battle_house_rules/).)

*You might like this if*: you love Harry Potter.

**Shadowrift** (5 plays), is my newest find in the co-op deck builder category. You should take my comments with a grain of salt because A) I've only played 5 times, and B) There is a revised 2nd Edition I've never seen (I acquired a 1st edition copy). In this game you are heroes defending a town from invading monsters, who apparently are coming in through a rift. You can win by either building walls around the town, or sealing the rifts. There are a couple of clever mechanics in this game, notably the Town and Traveler cards. Instead of just having a town with health points, you are actually constructing a deck of townspeople by hiring villagers to join the town. On your turn, you can use the abilities of the townsfolk to assist you in your fight. However, when the monsters kill someone in the town, they are replaced by Corpses, which (as you may guess) aren't great.

It's a neat take on the genre, and I like the decision space it provides for you. There is a variable market of cards to buy from, and the base game comes with 5 (6?) enemies to fight. Overall, it's an entertaining game with more good than bad.

The biggest issue I've had with the game is that you mix one Shadowrift per player into the monster deck of 20 cards. When those pop up makes a huge difference in winning. Too early and the game is a cake walk, too late and you might not survive. But compared to some of the other games, that issue isn't a game breaker.

I would absolutely recommend trying to grab a copy in a trade on the cheap (heck, there's even a [copy available for $1 plus shipping](https://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/product/1880465) right now). I understand that there's a 2nd Edition with expansions and more content, but the price tag seems high to me. I'm expecting to get 20+ plays out of it and then move it in a trade. I don't see it as a long term game without more content.

*You might like this if*: you want to play around with an interesting shared deck mechanic, you like trying out fun new games that won't take over your life

Well, speaking of taking over your life, let's talk about **Legendary: Marvel** (10 plays). I'm just going to lump all the flavors of Legendary together and call them Legendary: Marvel. There is a huge amount of content in the Legendary game universe, so you can explore it as deeply as you wish. Essentially every game you have a starting hand, there is a random market of cards, there are villains, and there's a big bad to fight. Every fight is slightly different due to the various mechanics brought to the table by your setup. Every game I've played of this has been enjoyable but not spectacular. In general it's a well tuned system that feels just a bit too sterile to me.

My friend owns lots of content for this game, and we always joke that playing Legendary is 3 games in 1. Game 1: Assemble the cards, Game 2: Play the game, Game 3: Sort all the cards and put everything away again.

*You might like this if*: you love the IP, you have an organization fetish

Now, before you yell at me that **Sentinels of the Multiverse** (12 plays) isn't a deck builder, let me just say this: You're correct. However, it feels so much like these other games that I feel it is legal to include this in the list. If you are looking for a co-op deck builder to play, SotM might be the game you love. Sentinels has a few amazing things going for it, and one big downside. The positives first: Awesome theme - just a wonderful comic book world that you get to play in. Great decks - instead of building a deck as you go, each hero has their own pre-constructed deck. And boy does each deck play differently. You get a real sense of how each hero is a different character by what they can do with their cards. Super quick to set up - grab hero decks, bad guy deck, environment deck, and your tokens. Bam! Ready to play.

Did I say ""tokens""? Ah, yes, to the negative - saying that Sentinels is a bit fiddly is like saying Campaign for North Africa runs a bit long. I'm getting ready to attack and I have a +1 Damage token on my guy, and there's another +1 Damage token ... is that for me, or only when attacking the Environment? Wait, why is that +1 Damage Taken token there? Did the card that brought that into play get discarded or not? What type of damage did he do? Am I immune to fire or not?

It's not insurmountable, and it definitely gets easier with multiple plays, but managing the tokens and health is a barrier to enjoying the game. If that sounds frustrating, don't even try this game. But if you can get over that hurdle, Sentinels offers some truly great experiences with very fun, thematic cards.

*You might like this if*: you like superheroes, cool combos, and are fine with fiddly mechanics

So, you thought I was cheating with Sentinels? How about this - my next game is **Orleans: Invasion** (20 plays), a game that doesn't even have cards! Before you string me up by my meeples, hear me out: Orleans is a bag builder, and a bag builder is simply a modified deck builder. I'm including it because I find this game definitely scratches some of the same itches of the other games on this list. You're working together, building up an engine, trying to beat the Big Bad.

In order to play the cooperative version of Orleans, you need the base game plus The Invasion expansion. On the one hand, that's a relatively big investment; on the other hand, you also have the exceptional base game of Orleans to play. The Invasion expansion does a masterful job of turning a purely competitive game into a cooperative experience. Each player gets their own role which requires them to achieve different goals along with the group goals. The roles change every game, and the random events change, so the puzzle is different every time. Difficulty can easily be scaled up or down. We have had numerous games that came down to the last turn, which is exactly what I want in a co-op.

*You might like this if*: you like bag building, you like Orleans

I'm saving the best for last, so it's time for **Aeon's End** (150+ plays). I won't deny that I'm a fanboy. Aeon's End has marched all the way up to be my #1 favorite game of all time. I own all content, and backed the latest Kickstarter. So at least you know where I'm coming from here.

In Aeon's End, you play mages who are trying to defend Gravehold from an attacking Nemesis. The primary strength of AE is the incredible variability you get with the different types of Mages, Nemeses, and market cards. Every game feels unique and different - a mage that might work well against one Nemesis could fall flat against a different one. My wife and I like to do a completely randomized setup, and then tweak it if we end up in a battle we can't win.

Mechanically, Aeon's End is a finely tuned machine. The vast majority of the games we've played have been entertaining and close. You feel like you're getting stronger, which is good because you know the minions get stronger as well. The Nemesis deck is built in tiers. Each Nemesis has their own unique cards, and those are mixed in with a random collection of basic cards. These are stacked with the easiest tier on top. The criticism could be: ""It takes longer to set up."" However, I will take a slightly longer setup time that gives me a better overall experience instead of the insta-lose games you can have with HP:HB or Shadowrun. And you are rarely put in a no-win situation. Even games where we lose in the mid-game are winnable with a strategy change. Most of the time we just reset the game and give it another go.

And, Aeon's End is simply cool. You have to open breaches to create more space to play more spells. You choose between gems, relics, and spells to buy to get the perfect deck. You can also charge up the special ability that only your mage has. The pace, flow, and feel of the game just sing for me. (Important note: I vastly prefer AE at 2P over 3 or 4. I just feel you get more powerful and can do more cool things at the lower player count.)

Finally, there are two important mechanics to mention. 1. A deck builder with no shuffling. It's a cool thing, because this game expects you to pack your discard pile to get powerful combos. It adds interesting decisions on when to buy a card, or when to hold cards in your hand for the next turn. 2. Variable turn order. At 2P, everybody (each mage and the Nemesis) get 2 turn order cards. Those 6 cards are shuffled and flipped to determine who goes when. It makes a procedural game more dynamic. This brings up another common complaint of AE: ""You can win or lose depending on how the turn order deck was shuffled!"" Often times that's true, but I love it - and if you end up losing, there was probably something better you could have done earlier to put yourself in a better position.

So there we go. Way too much text about co-op deckbuilders. I'd love to hear if anybody has other games they've played and would recommend. I've got a couple on my Want in Trade list, so hopefully they'll make it to my table at some point.",0.075,0.7,0.225,0.9999,688.9311

842,t3_cbk3py,Mansions of Madness House Rule,5,"So I've been playing mansions of madness on and off with 2 other friends, and routinely we find the game is extremely difficult or ponderous to play. Before we've explored half the map, scenarios tend to end, or enemies tend to pwn us. 20 attempts later, we still can't finish the Escape from Innsmouth. I had an idea for a rule to fix this where:

&amp;#x200B;

Investigators can move 1 extra space as a free action. This cannot be done if:

The player uses two move actions that turn. 

The player cannot use this move if an enemy monster is in line of sight or will be in line of sight during the player's turn.

&amp;#x200B;

It's an idea that the players are in a sort of ""exploring"" mode, and moving a great deal more carefree. However if a predator is close by, they need to be cautious, and watch their footing.

And I’m so glad I did. I have recently found the time to dedicate to this game properly and have been making my way through the *curse scenarios.* It has been an absolute blast of an experience and I can’t wait to play more. 

This game is kind of a slow burn. It’s not face paced, intense action or combat. It is interactive story telling reminiscent of when I read choose your own adventure books as a kid, which is exactly what they were going for. The exploration in this game is so much fun. Every time I get to a new tile, there’s so much I can do. And each choice usually is followed by another either/or decision that can have beneficial or damning consequences. I can craft equipment to help me along, but doing so might eventually cost me unless I’m being smart about how I use my resources. Each gamble I take on following a new path could ultimately leave me sick, hurt, or worse, dead. But the payoff is worth it when I’m rewarded with life-saving medicine, or a weapon to combat danger, or that ever important flame to keep hope alive. 

The game just tells the narrative so well with such little information presented on the board. Each section of terrain usually has a small piece of story attached to it, with each action also furthering the storyline as your progress. Plus, there’s so many different expansions now that this will have me entertained for a long time trying to get through each one. Granted, I’m sure there will be some slight overlap in cards because after all, there is a finite number in the game of certain options, however the way it is crafted, I doubt this will matter much as the way in which the situation presents will be completely different from any time it has presented before due to circumstance, progression, and game state. 

The only downside I could see is replay ability eventually running out or growing slightly stale. The first play through everything is new and there’s so many options to explore, you can’t possibly hope to hit all of them. Even if you decide to play through the same story a second and third time I could see it playing out differently because of card mechanics and choices. Eventually, however, it will exhaust itself to where you know all the results and by that point, I will have gotten my money’s worth several times over and I’ll only be too happy to part with the game to let someone else enjoy it for the first time. 

Group play is great, but it can get a little mucked up because there isn’t really a turn order dynamic and so quarterback or dominant players can often times take over or steamroll decisions, but if you have a solid play group that can work together, the game is a blast to explore with a group. However, solo it definitely shines. It’s one of those games in my collection where when I have a spare hour or two, I can break it out and just enjoy working through the story and seeing where it takes me. The *Save* mechanic that the game incorporates for keeping track of progress as well as easy break down and setup is great. It also becomes part of the story, in which there will be cases where you’ll have to rest and save in order to trigger certain events and replenish certain resources. It’s all just brilliantly designed. 

So I just cannot sing the praises of this game enough. I know it’s a little tough to find, but if you manage to get your hands on a copy or have the chance to, I highly recommend checking it out as it is an incredible narrative gaming experience. 

Plus, the company is so awesome that due to a printing hiccup the first time around, some of the card sizes were misprinted/miscut, and the company resent the proper sized cards to replace the initial run, free of charge. I’m sure that wasn’t cheap, but it was greatly appreciated. The customer service is top notch. I had the pleasure of meeting the designers/creators at GenCon50, who walked me through a play through of the game and were extremely nice, personable, and passionate. They also have a Kickstarter I think coming next year for their next entry in the choose your own adventure style gameplay called 7th Citadel I think? I’ll definitely be on board day 1 of that as well. 

**tl;dr / in summary:** The 7th Continent is an amazing gameplay experience and I highly recommend it. It plays incredibly well solo and also is fun in a group setting. If you can find a copy, I cannot recommend enough that you get you pick it up. If you like this type of interactive narrative game, I don’t see how you could be disappointed. It’s definitely in my top 5 favorite games of all time, with its only downside being replayability is eventually spoiled by knowing what’s going to happen next, when the surprise is gone.",0.055,0.716,0.229,0.9995,2.9985

**Description from Boardgamegeek**:

Champions of Midgard is a middleweight, Viking-themed, worker placement game with dice rolling in which players are leaders of Viking clans who have traveled to an embattled Viking harbor town to help defend it against the threat of trolls, draugr, and other mythological Norse beasts. By defeating these epic creatures, players gain glory and the favor of the gods. When the game ends, the player who has earned the most glory earns the title of Jarl and is recognized as a champion of Midgard!

Placing workers allows for the collection of resources and warriors, which players may then send on journeys to neighboring villages or across the sea to defeat monsters and gain the glory they need for victory. Resources are used to carve runes, build ships, and feed your followers. Viking warriors (custom dice) do battle with the myriad enemies the town faces.

857,t3_cc70i2,My Kickstarter Shock!!!,0,"Hi Guys, 
So I have been into board-gaming for over a year now, and like most people, it wasn’t long into my plunge that I came across the world of Kickstarter games. 

I am a backer on one game. And thus the SHOCK!!! 
I know this is common knowledge by now, but how it is okay that it has become a norm to deliver KS games 3/6 months late? 

I may sound critical here, but I am not actually that kind of person. Like I understand there can be unfortunate events out of the publishers control. But that’s different to what appears to me to be a norm where people order games expecting them to be late, not by a month but by 3 months or more. 

Like I have backed Eclipse: 2nd Dawn, and I was one of the many backers new the this world who wondered why it wasn’t coming when they said it would. I was shocked to find threads on BGG of new backers rightfully upset, and and older veterans comforting the newer guys by saying that MOST KS projects are in-fact 3/4 months late. 

And again, I realize that KS is for bringing projects to life that wouldn’t otherwise be viable. And so if KS had one or two board-gaming projects and these were late, then that would be totally understandable. But you would think after having been a platform for thousands of games that publishers would have come to a realistic knowledge of how long a given game will take. And yet this isn’t the case. 

So my question is, isn’t this at some point a lie to the customer, making us believe it will come in March, when actually they really know that’s unrealistic and it will actually only come in August?  Why can’t they just be more honest with the expectations they create? 

I am still very excited about my game, and I am probably going to back another game on KS, but it feels good get this off my chest. And in my opinion I highly regard publishers who deliver on time because it shows me a sense of integrity and commitment.",0.041,0.855,0.104,0.9731,0.0

Well , kickstarter. Apparently a lot of dissapointments come from there.

While it has an 8.8 on BGG, there are only 32 reviews and my friend said many of those could be from people trying to justify their purchase.

Game has a lot of miniatures and good quality ones are expensive and the current amount being pledged likely woulddnt be enough to cover it.

I've only played it 2p but it works great as a 2 player game. The hidden movements and all the abilities/gear cards are all just so good and thematic. It doesn't overstay it's welcome especially since you're essentially playing two different games between act 1 and act 2, and both complement each other really nicely. 

I found it pretty easy to teach, maybe just a few more rules than something like Forbidden Desert. I imagine this would only be easier with 4p as each person only has one character to control. Jaws' mechanisms aren't exactly groundbreaking but the way they tie into the theme makes this game a 9/10 for me. Every game has been really close and I've seen it go both ways with wins for the shark and for the crew.

Through the Desert would be easy to teach and play, do non gamers like it? And is it fun?

Maybe once every 2-3 years at most.

That said, I have an enduring fondness for the game that sends you raiding crumbling temples, trying to jump out of a car falling into a ravine (will I succeed? Find out next turn!) and fighting off nazis across the map.

I recently saw a new expansion pop up on several online retailers:

[https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/249601/fortune-and-glory-lair-spider-queen](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/249601/fortune-and-glory-lair-spider-queen) 

I know it's been pushed back a few times, but it seems like it's finally ""due soon"".

And this got me thinking about playing the game again. But if I'm going to bring it out, it might make sense to finally get an expansion to add to my base game.

I might wait for the new one. But I thought I would also ask whether anyone here has any favourite past expansion and, if so, what does it bring to the game? This might help me decide between getting Lair of the Spider Queen, or maybe trying to source an older expansion.

Then I'll get the joy of inflicting it on my most recent gaming groups. :)",0.015,0.855,0.13,0.9757,8.7813

We can't figure out whether combat cards or companion abilities come first. In our specific example, Gandalf the White has an ability that negates the leadership of the Nazgul. Meanwhile, shadow player has a combat card that gives bonuses based off of the Nazgul's leadership capability.  
  
So in this example, Player A chooses a combat card that gives bonuses to his units based on Nazgul leadership. The other player, then activates Gandalf's ability that erases all of Nazguls leadership points, which affects not only the combat itself, but nullifies the card that was just played. Is this how it should happen? Or do companions have a window in which they must declare their special ability? This step is not mentioned in any of the battle phase resolutions. Is the companion's special ability always active no matter what?  
  
Thank you in advance for any guidance, we are enjoying the game so far but it sure is a LOT.

892,t3_cbqill,Combining board games to make a bigger game!,32,"Hi all, I recently read (can't remember exactly where) about someone who likes to use a very short board game to replace an aspect of a different game. Also found out that the Century Spice Road games can be combined into one bigger game.

So my question is this - what interesting and creative ways can you all think of to combine multiple board games into one longer, epic game?

Examples I can think of off the top of my head:

1. When you are supposed to ""Go to Jail"" in **Monopoly**, instead play a game of **Whitehall Mystery** as the criminal and only go to jail if you get caught.
2. In **Cosmic Encounter**, convert the ship totals + encounter card values to ship points values and play a round of **X-Wing Miniatures Game** to decide the combat
3. When you need to gather wood/food in **Robinson Crusoe**, instead of rolling the die that tells you if you succeeded play a game of **Click Clack Lumberjack** or **Let's Go Fishing!** and only take the resource if you manage to get a certain number of bark/fish
