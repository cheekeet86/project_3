      "Hey guys, I'm basically the host whenever we have a board game session, so I read through the rules and played finish our first game. It was super intense, and we all came in like 58, 58 and 57.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, I've got a couple of questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) In the context of a new game / fresh board, it seems that oceans are a bad idea in terms of 'competitiveness'. It does not reward/incentivize anything. What I mean is: you spend resources placing an ocean down, and you don't even get the bonus. ANYONE ELSE can get the bonus. So you, as the person placing it, spend resources to put in a tile in which you only benefit from +1 to TR and placement bonuses, whereas someone else could just wait it out, place a greenery tile, own the area (which counts towards the landlord award and gardener milestone), get +1 to TR as well, AND also +1 VP from the greenery itself. (Not to mention +1 if he owns a city beside it). Thus I am having a hard time comprehending why would anybody want to ever place an ocean first. The opportunity cost is so much greater than if you were to just spend the same amount of resources building a greenery.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Some cards say \"require 7% oxygen\", I'm assuming this is require 7% oxygen OR GREATER, correct? Because it wouldn't be logical if it was literally playable on exactly 7% oxygen levels. (Asking this because some of the cards are worded with \"X% or less\" or \"X% or more\" whereas some cards dont have these texts)\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Some cards say, for example, add 2 microbes / animals to ANOTHER card. Does this mean that you must have another card that \"collects\" these resources? E.g. decomposers card collects microbes, so you can only add the microbes to this card, correct? I'm guessing if you don't have decomposers, or any other micro-resource collection card, then basically you can't add these micro-resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Because there are so many things to track / move everytime you do something, e.g. paying 8 plants to add a greenery tile, you have to physically move the cubes back to the cube pile, then add your tile, put the player marker, add the TR, raise the oxygen, and even many other power cards that may or may not activate. Thus, if a player forgets the passive of these cards, what's the best play here? Allow the player to retroactively get the resources or just too bad for him cuz he wasted his resources?\n",
      "\n",
      "5) In terms of the \"sabotage\" cards, e.g. meteors or asteroids which will remove plant resources from a player, what is the incentive of NOT doing so? It seems logical to ALWAYS do it (it is a competitive game after all) but the rules mention something about it being 'optional' and that 'it is not very nice' to do so.\n",

      "hey guys, i'm basically the host whenever we have a board game session, so i read through the rules and played finish our first game. it was super intense, and we all came in like 58, 58 and 57. anyway, i've got a couple of questions: 1) in the context of a new game / fresh board, it seems that oceans are a bad idea in terms of 'competitiveness'. it does not reward/incentivize anything. what i mean is: you spend resources placing an ocean down, and you don't even get the bonus. anyone else can get the bonus. so you, as the person placing it, spend resources to put in a tile in which you only benefit from +1 to tr and placement bonuses, whereas someone else could just wait it out, place a greenery tile, own the area (which counts towards the landlord award and gardener milestone), get +1 to tr as well, and also +1 vp from the greenery itself. (not to mention +1 if he owns a city beside it). thus i am having a hard time comprehending why would anybody want to ever place an ocean first. the opportunity cost is so much greater than if you were to just spend the same amount of resources building a greenery. 2) some cards say \"require 7% oxygen\", i'm assuming this is require 7% oxygen or greater, correct? because it wouldn't be logical if it was literally playable on exactly 7% oxygen levels. (asking this because some of the cards are worded with \"x% or less\" or \"x% or more\" whereas some cards dont have these texts) 3) some cards say, for example, add 2 microbes / animals to another card. does this mean that you must have another card that \"collects\" these resources? e.g. decomposers card collects microbes, so you can only add the microbes to this card, correct? i'm guessing if you don't have decomposers, or any other micro-resource collection card, then basically you can't add these micro-resources. 4) because there are so many things to track / move everytime you do something, e.g. paying 8 plants to add a greenery tile, you have to physically move the cubes back to the cube pile, then add your tile, put the player marker, add the tr, raise the oxygen, and even many other power cards that may or may not activate. thus, if a player forgets the passive of these cards, what's the best play here? allow the player to retroactively get the resources or just too bad for him cuz he wasted his resources? 5) in terms of the \"sabotage\" cards, e.g. meteors or asteroids which will remove plant resources from a player, what is the incentive of not doing so? it seems logical to always do it (it is a competitive game after all) but the rules mention something about it being 'optional' and that 'it is not very nice' to do so. thanks so much for all time and input. looking forward to more games of this, and probably will buy the expansions in the future.\n"

Ultimately, the leaders I picked hard countered a couple of his. Like, he had Byron (all your dudes have two life but only ever take one damage) and I had Lixis (1 damage to all opposing dudes every wave). He had Adjenna (opponents can't use clear corpse action) and I had Luca (you can redraw top card of discard pile if you use it right away, ie spam revive corpse orders). After about 8 matches and having seen each of our leaders, he scooped the pillar to me to save time. And no, there was no coming back, his scoop was not premature.\n",

Then on the other cube, I drafted mono red aggro, mono white midrange, and UB control. He drafted esper control, jund midrange, and WG aggro. He stormed back! My red deck lost two matches them barely beat wg on a mana screw. Then my W deck went 0-3. So now the match score is 5-5!!! First to 7 takes the pillar. Then my UB beats jund, barely, with game 5 ending in such a grind that he decks out. 6-5. Then my UB beats wg and takes down the pillar! Extremely nerve wracking.

      "Match 3: the game 2 arena says you can fall off the edge of the board and take 4 damage. I ban Wardlaw, his 3-4th main. He bans khadath. By the way, each of these battlecon matches was a different day, allowing the loser top rest and recoup. I reached the conclusion that I had been playing on yomi level zero (ie just playing what I thought were good attack pairs) and he was anticipating those. I went back to my old method of analyzing what his most likely pairs were. Game 1 my lucida crushes his merjoram. Both characters want to stand still and trade. Mine just does it better. He also didn't have his full concentration that day, hard reading me on several beats and just being bad at math and punting. Game 2 my Jin beats his Sarafina. Sara is one of my mains, which he hate drafted not really knowing how to use her. I hard read him a couple times, and my movement and hit confirm nullified his mix ups. I win the set 2-0 and trail 1 match to 2.\n",

      "Match 4: the game 2 arena says each beat has a 50% chance of recycling backwards. I ban Hepzibah (our consensus #1 pick agreed) he bans Kajia. Game 1 my rukyuk beats his iaxus. Neither of us plays these characters much, but I get there. Game 2 i got what I thought was a good match up, my malandrax versus his kehrolyn, but I actually had trouble keeping her off me and he got there. 1-1. Game 3 my clive versus his cadenza. He remarks that this is a great matchup for him since he can stun me off my modules. I stay silent. Basically I take one big hit and then keep him at bay the rest of the game. He even lands a grapnel but I foresee this and use the thing that negates his on hit effects, so he can't pull me. I take it down easily. 2-2 in matches. Fortunately I have my strongest team last. \n",

pillar 4: epic. so for those not familiar, this game is kinda mtg: lite. so we each have 3 sets of cards. we started by open drafting a deck and playing 3/5, which i took down. then we constructed 2 decks each and played 4 matches best 3/5 each. we split those. i took down the pillar best 3 of 5 matches (each 3/5 games). interestingly, one pair of decks we each built was quite similar, a red yellow control deck with lots of removal and recursion. pillar 5: battlecon. so we each drafted 20 fighters and split them into 5 teams of 4. we use each team once, best 3/5 matches (one team versus another team for a match). the format was this: simultaneously ban an opposing fighter. then play best of 3. game 1 you simultaneously pick an opposing fighter they can't use in game 1. game two features an arena effect. best 2/3 takes the match. match 1: the game 2 arena says that each beat, you gain a life if you didn't hit the opposing fighter. i ban madelina (scary) and he bans seth. game 1: my prince elien loses to clinhyde as i'm unable to ever benefit from my wall protection. game 2 is my tatsumi versus his runika. we dance around forever. i'm trying to gradually pick off his artifacts before engaging. late, i end up making a blunder on a beat where he couldn't even reach me by waking forward directly into his fist and giving the game away. he's up 1 match to none. match 2. the game 2 arena gradually fills the board up with candles on your space, end of beat, or damages you if you're on one. when board is full of candles, you can then ante candles you're on to gain various effects, including ignore stun guard. he bans aria, i ban shekhtur. game 1: my burgundy loses to his lymn. lymn constantly causes prio mix ups and i was repeatedly wrong. game 2 my karin plays way too predictably and loses to his main, zaamassal. he takes match 2 and now i'm totally in my own head, feeling like he can read me at every decision. match 3: the game 2 arena says you can fall off the edge of the board and take 4 damage. i ban wardlaw, his 3-4th main. he bans khadath. by the way, each of these battlecon matches was a different day, allowing the loser top rest and recoup. i reached the conclusion that i had been playing on yomi level zero (ie just playing what i thought were good attack pairs) and he was anticipating those. i went back to my old method of analyzing what his most likely pairs were. game 1 my lucida crushes his merjoram. both characters want to stand still and trade. mine just does it better. he also didn't have his full concentration that day, hard reading me on several beats and just being bad at math and punting. game 2 my jin beats his sarafina. sara is one of my mains, which he hate drafted not really knowing how to use her. i hard read him a couple times, and my movement and hit confirm nullified his mix ups. i win the set 2-0 and trail 1 match to 2. match 4: the game 2 arena says each beat has a 50% chance of recycling backwards. i ban hepzibah (our consensus #1 pick agreed) he bans kajia. game 1 my rukyuk beats his iaxus. neither of us plays these characters much, but i get there. game 2 i got what i thought was a good match up, my malandrax versus his kehrolyn, but i actually had trouble keeping her off me and he got there. 1-1. game 3 my clive versus his cadenza. he remarks that this is a great matchup for him since he can stun me off my modules. i stay silent. basically i take one big hit and then keep him at bay the rest of the game. he even lands a grapnel but i foresee this and use the thing that negates his on hit effects, so he can't pull me. i take it down easily. 2-2 in matches. fortunately i have my strongest team last. match 5: game 2 arena says the lower health player can move a barrier marker and nobody can end their movement on it. i ban adjenna, his second main, he bans thessala, my #1 pick. game 1 my cherri squeaks out a win against cesar. game 2 in the arena is my lesandra versus his lixis. i request we play game 3 first since i have a great matchup, which we do. my baenvier crushes his orianna. i wait till he commits a lot of magic points to an attack them simply negate our styles, rendering his character practically useless. i win the final match and thus the pillar (making a huge comeback) and thus the entire olympiad. pillar 6: chudyk. best 4/7 mottainai, best 2/3 impulse, best 2/3 gtr. whoever wins two of those takes it. he wins mottainai 4-3 but we don't end up completing the pillar because i won battlecon that afternoon and ended it. pillar 7: beat 2/3 food chain magnate. didn't start this one. well hope you enjoyed reading this. we had a great time playing the most epic gaming marathon ever. took 80 hours to finish.\n"

      "so i have a vacation home in the pacific northwest. i invited several friend to go relax, retreat, and game, but most of the time it wa my best buddy and me. we created a gaming olympiad, a heptathalon (if that's a word), and i'm going to tell you all about it! if you wanna read only about certain events, you can skip forward to: 1: pixel tactic 2: mtg power cube 3: deck builder 4: epic 5: battlecon 6: carl chudyk 7: food chain magnate the olympiad consisted of 7 events, or pillars. first to win 4 take it down. we jumped around from pillar to pillar each day to prevent burn out on one game. pillar 1: pixel tactic constructed. create 3 deck from all the sets. play each deck versus each opposing deck twice each (18 games) plus one game with the deck of your choice. best 10/19 game take the pillar. this pillar took an incredible amount of prep. we had to sort through about 15 card and pick 3 leader to build around. that took day of analysis paralysis. ultimately, the leader i picked hard countered a couple of his. like, he had byron (all your dude have two life but only ever take one damage) and i had lixis (1 damage to all opposing dude every wave). he had adjenna (opponents can't use clear corpse action) and i had luca (you can redraw top card of discard pile if you use it right away, ie spam revive corpse orders). after about 8 match and having seen each of our leaders, he scooped the pillar to me to save time. and no, there wa no coming back, his scoop wa not premature. pillar 2: mtg power cubes. i have two vintage powered cubes. one that is more combo oriented and balanced, and one that ha almost no combo and is more interactive. so we started with the combo cube. we pack drafted two deck simultaneously, having to allocate each drafted card to deck a or b. then each deck played each opposing deck in a best 3/5 match. that's 4 match so far. then we used the other cube and simultaneously drafted 3 deck and played each against each other in a 3/5 (9 more matches). best 7/13 match take the pillar. so in the first cube, i dominated. drafted a show n tell style deck and a mono green crater hoof natural order deck. he drafted a reanimator deck and a mono white control/armageddon/winter orb/stax deck. both mine beat both of his and i took a 4-0 match advantage. then on the other cube, i drafted mono red aggro, mono white midrange, and ub control. he drafted esper control, jund midrange, and wg aggro. he stormed back! my red deck lost two match them barely beat wg on a mana screw. then my w deck went 0-3. so now the match score is 5-5!!! first to 7 take the pillar. then my ub beat jund, barely, with game 5 ending in such a grind that he deck out. 6-5. then my ub beat wg and take down the pillar! extremely nerve wracking. i thought he wa gonna crack my 4-0 lead!!! pillar 3: deck building. so we were really limited on game due to suitcase space. so in this pillar, we would play star realms, tanto cuore, and flip city, each best 3/5. whoever win two of those three take the pillar. we start with star realms. i win two in a row then he win 3. then we play flip city and he sweep me. take down the pillar in under 2 hours!!

      "recently played gp for the first time (have never played terra mystica) with my wife. looking through some thread i think both of u didn't play a very optimal strategy, but for my wife, her engine petered out at the end leaving her pretty disappointed. basically in round 5 and 6 i ended up with a whole bunch more turn than her, and (my bad) i probably poured salt in the wound by racking up extra end game points. i got to the top of the knowledge track at round 4 and then ended up with a bunch of extra actions. neither of u did a single gaiaformer though which given the name of the game wa probably bad play. currently this may be a game that she doesn't play again although i'm trying to convince her to give it one more go (she felt the end game wa monopolyesque--i.e. you're getting your butt kicked and there isn't anything you can do). i just thought of an idea that we could play coop against the automa to learn it better together also. #x200b; so.... is this typical in this game or no? will experienced player score much closer or can you see blowout often? are round 1 bad move carried through the whole game? edit: thanks for all the tip and suggestion edit2:probably got a rule wrong\n",

My family wasn’t used to playing board games outside of Monopoly or Sorry, so our mindset wasn’t really in the right place for a little more strategic game like Catan.

I feel like there's a common pain point here: board game companies not quite hitting the mark with their game pieces. To be fair, I'm sure most people play Batman with maybe 4 players. Also to be fair, the cardboard measuring sticks for Fallout work just as well, and the company does sell acrylic ones, but they're $25 for one set (the core game comes with 2 sets of cardboard ones). HOWEVER. I'd like to know which pieces of which games could do with an unlicensed, third party, compatible product made of plastic. Resin can be transparent or opaque.

I don’t know how a game this popular is so bad. I bought this game on a whim on vacation because it was early in my days in the hobby and thought, “all these people can’t be wrong.” I read the rules and instantly wondered what the point was. Munchkin will continue to print money and I’m happy for them, but this isn’t for me. I’ll refuse to play.\n",

      "99\\. **Monopoly Gamer** - 1 Play – This is still Monopoly, people. I bought this for my nephew for Christmas, so of course I had to play a game with him. While, the theme is awesome, the components are awesome, this game has no decisions. At least it was quick.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",

      "98\\. **Holding On: The Troubled Life of Billy Kerr** - 4 Plays – One of my biggest disappointments in my board gaming life. I’m a sucker for unique theme and this had such an interesting one for me. The mechanics, however, are absolute trash. This is a luck fest, and if you fail a mission, you have to do it over and over and over and over again until you beat it. The story did seem cool, but you’re looking at the same cards every game and it was such a slog to get through. This game is for sale, if you’d like to try it after this glowing review.\n",

I bought this for my 2 year old daughter at Origins this year and she was so excited I brought her a game home. She always likes playing with my pieces, but now she had one of her own. She made it a point that it had to be on daddy’s shelf. I’ll cherish my memories of that moment and my plays of it, but this is still a game for toddlers.\n",

      "96\\. **One Night Ultimate Werewolf** - 1 Play – 1 play was enough for me, but I’m sure I’ll get comments saying it requires multiple plays. I don’t like that it’s 10 minutes. It’s social deduction, but no way to deduce who’s good and who’s bad socially. It starts with a guess and then 2 minutes of pandering. I would play this in a group if someone reallllly wanted to, but it just doesn’t interest me.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "95\\. **Jenga** - 4 Plays – The only way to play Jenga is to play Drinking Jenga. Put different tasks on each brick, when it’s pulled, whoever pulls it, does the task. My personal favorite block in my set is “Secret Terrorist”. The person who pulls it, writes down a word. If that word is said by any other player, they smack the tower as hard as they can.\n",

The expansion makes it a tiny bit better, but the choices are so easy. Go to the closest spot always, get points for everything. This was a gift and looks good on my shelf, only reason it stays.

      "92\\. **Small World** - 4 Plays (recorded) - One of my first favorite games. It reminded me a lot of my childhood favorite, Risk. I may say this more than once, I’m not sure, but VARIABILITY DOES NOT EQUAL REPLAYABILITY. The monster + power combos create variability, but they’re all pretty much the same. The area control is mundane and you really never have enough to hold on to anything. And I have to mention that you spend 1/3 of the game declining and not playing the game.\n",

      "91\\. **Ex Libris** - 2 Plays – Another huge disappointment for me. A game I was looking forward to for a long time because of the really unique them. This game has so much going on for how light it is. The worker placement is annoying because you’re constantly needing to read new buildings, even though they’re all pretty much the same. Remember, variability does not equal replayability (that was fast). Every spot is get more cards or rearrange your shelf. I like the tableau building with the books, but that adds about 5 things to remember for scoring too. You have to think about tableau building which scores for 3-5 different things, 10 placement spots that are constantly revolving, variable player powers for different workers for each player. It’s just so much for such a light game\n",
      " i really got into the hobby around march 2017 when i received small world, lords of waterdeep, and betrayal at house on the hill for my birthday. i had played games before, but didn’t start buying and really playing until around this time. in june 2017, i downloaded bg stats and started recording my plays. on july 16, 2019, i hit 100 unique games played. this is my ranking of those games. 100\\. **munchkin** - 1 play - i don’t know how a game this simple can have such a bad set of rules? i don’t know how a game with such a bad set of rules got so popular? i don’t know how a game this popular is so bad. i bought this game on a whim on vacation because it was early in my days in the hobby and thought, “all these people can’t be wrong.” i read the rules and instantly wondered what the point was. munchkin will continue to print money and i’m happy for them, but this isn’t for me. i’ll refuse to play. 99\\. **monopoly gamer** - 1 play – this is still monopoly, people. i bought this for my nephew for christmas, so of course i had to play a game with him. while, the theme is awesome, the components are awesome, this game has no decisions. at least it was quick. 98\\. **holding on: the troubled life of billy kerr** - 4 plays – one of my biggest disappointments in my board gaming life. i’m a sucker for unique theme and this had such an interesting one for me. the mechanics, however, are absolute trash. this is a luck fest, and if you fail a mission, you have to do it over and over and over and over again until you beat it. the story did seem cool, but you’re looking at the same cards every game and it was such a slog to get through. this game is for sale, if you’d like to try it after this glowing review. 97\\. **unicorn glitterluck: cloud stacking** - 4 plays – in sentimental value, this game is top 10. i bought this for my 2 year old daughter at origins this year and she was so excited i brought her a game home. she always likes playing with my pieces, but now she had one of her own. she made it a point that it had to be on daddy’s shelf. i’ll cherish my memories of that moment and my plays of it, but this is still a game for toddlers. 96\\. **one night ultimate werewolf** - 1 play – 1 play was enough for me, but i’m sure i’ll get comments saying it requires multiple plays. i don’t like that it’s 10 minutes. it’s social deduction, but no way to deduce who’s good and who’s bad socially. it starts with a guess and then 2 minutes of pandering. i would play this in a group if someone reallllly wanted to, but it just doesn’t interest me. 95\\. **jenga** - 4 plays – the only way to play jenga is to play drinking jenga. put different tasks on each brick, when it’s pulled, whoever pulls it, does the task. my personal favorite block in my set is “secret terrorist”. the person who pulls it, writes down a word. if that word is said by any other player, they smack the tower as hard as they can. 94\\. **kingdom builder** - 1 play – dave luza is correct. this game is literal trash. 93\\. **tokaido** - 9 plays – pretty game, cool theme, blah, blah, blah. this game is just kind of…boring. others describe it as chill. the expansion makes it a tiny bit better, but the choices are so easy. go to the closest spot always, get points for everything. this was a gift and looks good on my shelf, only reason it stays. can someone please tell me why this game gets so much love? 92\\. **small world** - 4 plays (recorded) - one of my first favorite games. it reminded me a lot of my childhood favorite, risk. i may say this more than once, i’m not sure, but variability does not equal replayability. the monster + power combos create variability, but they’re all pretty much the same. the area control is mundane and you really never have enough to hold on to anything. and i have to mention that you spend 1/3 of the game declining and not playing the game. 91\\. **ex libris** - 2 plays – another huge disappointment for me. a game i was looking forward to for a long time because of the really unique them. this game has so much going on for how light it is. the worker placement is annoying because you’re constantly needing to read new buildings, even though they’re all pretty much the same. remember, variability does not equal replayability (that was fast). every spot is get more cards or rearrange your shelf. i like the tableau building with the books, but that adds about 5 things to remember for scoring too. you have to think about tableau building which scores for 3-5 different things, 10 placement spots that are constantly revolving, variable player powers for different workers for each player. it’s just so much for such a light game\n"

I would try and make bets where the loser had to buy Meeple Circus. I just had to stack an elephant meeple on a tiger on a strong man. But man, it was underwhelming.

This game should’ve come with a sand timer. If you don’t make a move in 30 seconds, you lose a billion coins. You may remember from the last 10 that VARIABILITY DOES NOT EQUAL REPLAYABILITY. This is the poster child. Set up is always different, different djinns, market row…ton of variability. The optimal strategy stays the same though. Don’t bid high, something will be there for you. Go for green and set collect as much as possible. As soon as I’m finished with my 10x10, this game is going gone.\n",

It felt like war. I don’t get the whole “I don’t like game X because it didn’t make me feel like a coal miner.” It’s a board game! You’re pushing around cardboard and plastic! But Risk did make me feel like a war strategist. It just doesn’t hold up now that I’ve played other games. It’s too long. It’s too luck dependent. It’s too king-making.

      "I really enjoy playing games in the Lovecraft universe and I also like to play 2 player games every now and then so I really had to buy the Arkham Horror LCG when I got the chance. I already own Eldritch Horror and often play Mansions of Madness 2nd Edition so I was interested where this would fit in to the collection. However, after playing the first campaign through maybe 4 times I really cannot see where all the hype is coming from so I want to hear from others what it is that they like about the game. I will list some of the reasons why I like the other two much better.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "**Set Up:** The LCG has a VERY large setup and pack away time in my opinion, and it at least feels that it takes as long as Eldritch to set up and certainly longer than Mansions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Story:** I was fairly underwhelmed with the story side of the LCG. Much of the flavour text is repeated in one paragraph or two in 2 or 3 different locations. There is some branching of paths but it feels very minimal to me. In contrast, I think that the storytelling in Mansions is far superior and that the story really drives the game forward. Some of the newer scenarios in particular are amazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Character Development:** In the LCG character development is mostly done by modifying your deck. To me this feels underwhelming because one might add 2 or 3 cards over the course of a campaign and you may never in see them in your playthrough, as the decks are quite large. In contrast I find the character development in Eldritch very exciting because you find a lot of items that drastically change play, new spells, and improving skills has a huge impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cost:** This is a big one, probably the biggest. A 4 player version of the LCG costs something like 70 euro (having to buy 2 copies of the game). This is more expensive than either Eldritch or Mansions and has SO many fewer pieces AND scenarios. This includes one campaign with three missions. The value from Eldritch or Mansions seems far superior to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Replayability:** I think that the LCG does have a good amount of replayability. You can play with different combinations of the 4 characters and try to figure out ways to win with those combinations. However, there is only one story in the box and the branching paths are very minimal. Mansions has I think 5 scenarios out of the box and new ones are much cheaper than the LCG expansions. Eldritch is not so story based so the comparison is not entirely fair but it does come with 4 elder gods and I think 12 characters so the replayability is much higher in my opinion. \n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in conclusion I find that the LCG sits somewhere between Eldritch and Mansions. However, if you like the storytelling side then you are better off with mansions, if you prefer the character development side then go with Eldritch. Not to mention that both of these are, in my opinion, MUCH better value for money than the LCG. I am very interested to hear from others who have played other games in the universe and why they think that the LCG is the superior game.\n",

      "Hey all. I’m back with another semi-weekly article on the journey of creating a home-brew Spirit. After coming up with an idea for a Spirit, I had to do additional research in order to make sure that the idea fit thematically.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Thematic Research**\n",
      "\n",
      "I started with a simple google search. Something along the lines of “phenomenon found in deserts” and went from there. From the list of resulting sites I made a list of ideas that could potentially be used to create a desert/antlion based Spirit:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Oasis\n",
      "* Mirage\n",
      "* Haboob/Sandstorm\n",
      "* Desert Heat\n",
      "* Cactus\n",
      "* Desert Varnish\n",
      "* Flash Floods\n",
      "* Quicksand\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I decided to figure out the play style. My initial reaction was to embrace the antlion fantasy of gathering in Invaders and then destroying them. Both would most likely be Innate Powers. In order to facilitate that, I needed a Special Rule (or two) that would allow the theme to come through into the mechanical realm of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I settled on the following Special Rules:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Presence can only be placed in the Sands.\n",
      "2. When Presence is placed, gather 1 Explorer or 1 Town or 1 Dahan into that same land.\n",
      "   1. Note: The astute player will notice that there is definitely something wrong with this Special Rule, but we’ll get into that in a later article.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I decided to get a little weird and add one more that I thought might be interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Plant and Water Elements count as Sun instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted the Spirit to be unique and play differently, and to me this last rule would help set it up to be different enough from the other Spirits because it would most likely contain high numbers of Sun Elements in its Innate Power Element thresholds. I was fascinated by the idea of having a Spirit whose final Innate Power Element threshold was something around the magnitude of 10 Sun Elements to trigger. A card that provided a Sun, Water, and Plant Symbol would instead generate 3 Sun Elements. You’ll see how this Special Rule fared in future articles.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now that I had a basic idea of Special Rules and some ideas for Innate Powers, I went back to the thematic research and began crafting the Unique Power Cards. I took the same list and jotted down ideas for each thing:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Oasis\n",
      "   * Remove a blight\n",
      "   * Gather Invaders\n",
      "   * Gather Dahan\n",
      "* Mirage\n",
      "   * Fear\n",
      "   * Gather Invaders\n",
      "* Haboob/Sandstorm\n",
      "   * Destroy Explorers\n",
      "   * Destroy Towns\n",
      "   * Fear\n",
      "   * Push Explorers\n",
      "   * Push Towns\n",
      "   * Defend\n",
      "   * Skip Actions\n",
      "* Desert Heat\n",
      "   * Deal damage with extra in Sands\n",
      "* Cactus\n",
      "   * Wilds tokens\n",
      "   * Defend\n",
      "* Desert Varnish\n",
      "   * Defend\n",
      "* Flash Floods\n",
      "   * Ultimately decided against trying to describe this one since River had a Flash Flood card already.\n",
      "* Quicksand\n",
      "   * Defend\n",
      "   * Wilds\n",
      "   * Beasts\n",
      "   * Destroy Explorers\n",
      "   * Fear\n",
      "* Singing Sand Dunes (Look it up, it’s pretty cool)\n",
      "   * Gather Explorers\n",
      "   * Fear\n",
      "\n",
      "I did realize at a later date that Quicksand isn’t actually a desert thing (as portrayed in movies) since its composition requires a decent amount of water, which isn’t something that deserts are particularly rife with. Hindsight is 20/20, so I decided to go with it at the beginning since it seemed so versatile.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m a Computer Scientist by trade and I find that naming things is incredibly difficult sometimes. As such, I waffled all over the place trying to come up with a name for this Spirit. I really wanted it to have a name like Shifting Sands Consume the Lost, or Shifting Sands Devours the Doomed, but the alliterations were killing me. I threw around other weird names like Shifting Sand’s Black Blizzard, or even Desert As An All Consuming Void (blech). It was really hard. Then I finally settled on **Shifting Desert’s Gaping Maw**. It just felt right saying it and reading it on paper, so that’s what I went with. The name has grown on me since then and I don’t think I’ll change it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now with a name and some basic ideas of thematic elements I could use to bring the Spirit to life, I moved on to the next step, creating the first (very rough) draft.\n",

      "So I joined a different gaming group for the first time. There were about 8 people chatting and waiting for 7 PM to roll around. This group meets for range of game types. Walking in I saw games like **Imperial**, **Imperial Settlers**, **Sushi Go Party**, **Manhattan Project**, **Chinatown**, **Power Grid**, and **Endeavor**.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have always wanted to try **Imperial Settlers**, so I joined with a girl, *J*, who has also never played and I believe the owner of the copy...let's call him *El*. So El breaks out all components and is explaining the empires, the expansions present, and which ones he recommended we start with. Cool. I don't know the game so I'm not picky about my empire. J got Barbarians, I got Egypt (not exactly for beginners) and he chose Japan.\n",
      "\n",
      "We begin the teach. It isn't very organized and he is explaining *how* to play the game at a pretty brisk pace. Swords and stones and wood and razing and foundations and deals and actions and production...*UGH*. A few minutes in I ask, \"So what are we going for here?,\" asking really for our **purpose**. He stops, looks at me with impatient confusion and says, \"You're trying to get points. You're trying to get the most VP.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well yeah,\" I reply. \"I see we are going for VP. I mean what is our purpose here? What are we trying to do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're trying to build a empire by building structures with resources that give you bonuses throughout the game,\" he forces out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oohhhh!\" J and I let out in unison. The swords and stones and foundations all made much more sense! We continue on with the teach following along with considerable more ease.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's time to complete setup. El's hands are sweeping across the table, grabbing our starting resources and placing them on our boards. J and I being new, we weren't quite sure why we got different starting resources. It had to be explained to us again. OK moving on. J is first player, chosen by that pretty neat app on El's phone that detects everyone's finger pressed on the screen and randomly chooses FP. \n",
      "\n",
      "Time to draft cards (the *Lookout Phase*). El lays out the four (3P+1) cards in front of us. Before J, the first player, can absorb what has been placed in front of her, El calls out the optimal card and suggests she takes that one. She pauses to read the other cards, but ends up choosing El's suggestion. El shifts the cards to me and calls out the next optimal card. \"You should take this one,\" and explains why it is the best option. El's brusque disposition was really starting to show here, most surely elevated from his fiery ardor for boardgames.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold on a second, man. Let me see what's going on here,\" I leveled. I wanted to read these damn cards and learn what types of options we would be presented with during the game. As a learner, it's important to learn what is out there as much as it is to identify \"optimal\" cards. We draft cards in the opposite order, again experiencing El's declarations of the best cards for us before we could read and understand any of the cards placed in front of us. OK, here we go. Let's just play this game and have a good time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The game gets going. Not long into it, I notice another antic of El's. His lower jaw is down and jutting out, chest rising and falling as air rushed into and out of his mouth, eyes piercing his cards as he studies them. The only thing missing was a caption hanging below his head: *[Heavy breathing intensifies]*. This dude *loves* this game. As J and I place cards down, El's eyes get locked on our cards as they are laid. He identifies the cards the instant he sees the front, and is again declaring to us what they mean, what we get, even which side to place the cards, and as I slide the card into place, all my resources earned have already been placed in my tableau.\n",
      "\n",
      "The game goes on like this. El is moving our resources around, taking what we intend to spend and grabbing what we intend to take. His hands are in our tableau as much as he is spending in his. A few times I had to motion my hands in an attempt to slow him down and allow me to *think* through my own damn options. I didn't score as well as they did come game end. I owe part of that due to refusing to play his suggestions out of my own frustration from his intrusive \"facilitation\" of the game. I didn't have that great of a time and I likely will avoid his table from this point on.\n",
      "\n",
      "So to my boardgame community I say, it's fine if your heart rate climbs when you hear that cardboard fart when opening up your favorite game. It is certainly a good thing to show the world all the awesome games it has never played. But fuck me, if you want them to have a good time and you want to ensure they know *how*--and want--to play the game next time around, get your damn hands off their tokens and game pieces, know when to bite your tongue and let them think--and act--for themselves (unless they are struggling or ask), and *let. them. fucking. play.*\n",
      "\n",
      "Funny enough, I vented to my partner and he immediately reminded me of how he had to tell me in the past not to place my hands in any way on his side of the table due to pretty much the same reasons. So I am guilty too, but I'm more woke now following that game night. I will make every effort to allow newbies to a game their own physical and mental space for maximum enjoyment. Thanks for reading.\n",

      "**Edit:** I'll acknowledge the personal element here and say that it isn't necessary for my testimony. I'll leave it in here for readers' reference but I will admit it wasn't necessary to convey my main message. I was trying to paint a picture, and I chose the wrong way to do it. El, you showed up in this thread. I apologize for the personal attack, but my message still stands. I don't think that should change now that you saw this post. Like I said, a lot of us are guilty in letting our excitement get the best of us, and it may become overbearing to others when we forget to slow down and let new players truly experience the game. I, particularly, enjoy the try-fail-experiment-succeed element of learning a game. I don't want to know the best move, I want to learn my way there. I think some here will identify with that. It just wasn't a good pairing of teacher-learner styles and thought I'd offer to the community, by example, a teaching style that is adverse to the learners' experience.\n"

      "Ok so I was going to buy TI4 but my friend is buying it instead, so now I'm eyeing gloomhaven as my next purchase, however my friend told me that a 'problem' with gloomhaven is that I need the same people to play everytime. Looking at the reviews and some gameplay I think I'd enjoy it with 2 or 3 players, but I only have one friend who would be down to play once a week and eventually he will be moving out for college. So my question is how does the story/campaign work in gloomhaven. Is it like mage knight where the story basically is different scenarios which can be played any time with different players or is it like DND campaign that must have all the same players throughout the entire gloomhaven experience? Can I go through one mission and then proceed to the next mission with an entirely different friend group? I can eliminate this problem by just playing the game solo, but is it even fun to play solo?! If gloomhaven owners or ppl who have played the game can help clear these questions out for me and offer more insight into the game and how it plays so I can decide to buy the game I'd really appreciate it.\n",

      "As I'm reading about Feld's latest game, [Revolution of 1828](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/265260/revolution-1828), I thought about ranking my favourite 10 games that he designed. His trademark games comprise multiple yet simple scoring systems ('point salads' to some), but the games revolve around mechanisms that limit the available options on any player's given turn. Therefore, players focus on action manipulation and managing flexibility. Anyway, here is my list. I know a few highly rated titles did not make it. Happy to see your list!\n",
      "\n",
      "\\#10. **Aquasphere** \\- an interesting mix of rondel and delayed action selection. It's one of the more cutthroat Feld games as there is area control scoring and you can bump other players' pieces back to reduce their scoring opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\#9. **Macao** \\- a simple yet brilliant design. Select coloured dice with pip value N, giving you N cubes of that colour N rounds from now. Any unused cubes on a round are lost. Would have been a higher place if the scoring is more exciting and the rulebook is better written.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\#8. **Carpe Diem -** the latest design on this list. The gameplay is simple, place a tile from a central market onto your board to earn bonuses and end game points for completed features. The round-to-round scoring is interesting: every round you must fulfil two adjacent scoring objectives on a randomised grid. Failing to do so results in losing points. It's a game about managing flexibility.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\\#7. **Notre Dame -** A card drafting game in which everyone starts with the same deck so you have a bit of control over what your neighbours can do. It's very smooth and the expansion added more variability.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\#6. **Bora Bora** \\- a worker placement using dice. Higher number offers more powerful actions but a lower number blocks out a worker placement spot for any comparatively higher numbers. Very tight and sometimes brutal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\#5. **Trajan -** Move cogs clockwise around a mancala and do the action corresponding to the final place you drop off a cog. It rewards planning ahead your next 5+ moves. Used to be higher on the list but perhaps I've played it too many times. \n",
      "\n",
      "\\#4. **The Speicherstadt**  / Jorvik - The game of queuing. Queue up to buy a card, where the price equals the number of people in that queue.  Queue earlier for a better chance of getting what you want (sometimes at a steep price) and queue later to spite your opponents (or maybe end up get something cheap!). One of the most interactive Feld games and the length hits a sweet spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\#3. **Luna -** a perfect information game. This is about positioning your workers at the right place at the right time. A brilliant mix of short term tactics and long term strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\#2. **Bruges -** a game of multi-use cards. Highly replayable especially with the expansion. Satisfying when you pull off combos or outwit your opponents on one of the majority scoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\#1. **Castles of Burgundy -** no surprises here. Very satisfactory to plan ahead and set off chain reactions.\n",

      "While the thinking-phase of the game can vary in length depending on player experience, the combat is a persistent drag. Despite being logistically simple, the sheer amount of fiddliness with tokens and identifying damage done based on the colour of the die rolled means that it frequently brings the game to a grinding halt. That said, the asymmetric design of the game is relatively flawless: the Rebels have weaker forces but are able to constantly undermine the Empire, who struggle to pin them down despite their strength in numbers. This tension aptly matches the tone of the conflict in the Star Wars universe.\n",

      "Verdict: This game has been tough to recommend to friends, despite it’s 5-15 minute playtime, because the rules don’t seem as easy as other compact experiences.

      "This is a mammoth game that succeeds at taking players on a sprawling campaign featuring a unique and engaging selection of playable classes, varied yet easy-to-learn mechanics, and inventive ways of repurposing a vast core set of components.

      "You are part of a Guild trying to survive in the city of Gloomhaven and the surrounding wilds. Over the course of 100 or so missions (with objectives such as ‘kill all monsters on the board’ or ‘escort the NPC from one corner of the board to another), players create and retire several characters as they follow a non-linear story in a world that gradually reveals itself. This is the closest thing to D’n’D in a box, without the need for a GM.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overarching player/character development feels like a video game as you upgrade abilities, make moral choices, and find more loot, while the main gameplay is a cross between cooperative card gaming and strategic turn-based combat.

The story isn’t going to win any awards, but it is satisfyingly fun context for any guild of adventurers.\n",

Games that last several hours are typically tests of endurance and brainpower, testing players logistical ability to evolve their strategies based on the way the opponent is developing. Despite the draw of these exhaustive games to experienced players, the games that stand the test of time and get brought back to the table are those that respect your time, allow you to improve your skills, and provide unique experiences with each new game.\n",

      "Whereas the games that last several hours absolutely require that you are with a group of people that are equally as committed to playing as you are, shorter games are great for playing with people you want to know better, or want to gauge the interest of before proposing an 8 hour Twilight Imperium Campaign. The best of these will expose something about the deeper personalities of the people around you in a microcosm, with the real challenge being how you read other players rather than rebut their actions. They are often perfect ice breakers or time-fillers for social occasions with friends and strangers alike, rather than being the sole focus of an entire evening (or longer).\n",

      "*this is my first attempt at reviewing boardgames and at writing for a blog. i'd really like to hear what people think of it, and if there's an audience for these kind of themed collated micro reviews:* #x200b; as tabletop gaming has started to gain newfound traction, with fans flocking to kickstarter to express their support, the want for ‘more stuff’ is increasing in demand. gloomhaven, for example, rose to the highest rank of boardgamegeek by fulfilling the promise of a dungeon-crawling campaign that could take literally years to complete. smaller, bitesize cardboard experiences may not be quite as complex or immersive as their expansive big-boy-box counterparts, but there are some that manage to be incredibly rewarding, without requiring you to sacrifice an entire evening for the pleasure. in the first of this series of collated board game micro-reviews, i want to look at a few games both big and small that attempt to strike a delicate balance between content and engagement, for those who want to be as efficient as possible with their tabletop time. #x200b; **big - star wars: rebellion** never trust a board game by its suggested playtime. i have failed to heed my own advice too many times when bringing this game to the table. 2-4 hours seems like all the time this cat-and-mouse race through space should need, what could possibly go wrong? one player or team of two takes command of the massively overpowered empire, attempting to locate and blow up the rebel base, controlled by the rebels, who are simply trying to survive. there’s a set amount of rounds in the game, which the rebels can reduce by completing special objectives, but there’s such a variety of cool-sounding things to do every round that it can take an exceedingly long time to plan and execute. while the thinking-phase of the game can vary in length depending on player experience, the combat is a persistent drag. despite being logistically simple, the sheer amount of fiddliness with tokens and identifying damage done based on the colour of the die rolled means that it frequently brings the game to a grinding halt. that said, the asymmetric design of the game is relatively flawless: the rebels have weaker forces but are able to constantly undermine the empire, who struggle to pin them down despite their strength in numbers. this tension aptly matches the tone of the conflict in the star wars universe. verdict: rebellion is relatively easy to pick up and play, but the brainpower required to outwit your opponent can too often result in epics that take longer to resolve than a trilogy of films. for everything there is to love about the vast majority of the experience, it can’t help but feel like a slog by the end. the combat definitely doesn’t help. #x200b; **small - love letter** like the early seasons of game of thrones, this isn’t about thrilling battles, epic dragons, and illogical plot developments - this is about sordid romantic conspiracies and tactical masterminds deceiving their allies to distract from what’s hidden up their sleeve. as a player you attempt to unveil and eliminate all other possible suitors of a princess until one lover is left standing, or by ending a round with the closest connection to the princess (a.k.a holding the highest number card). you only have two cards available to use on your turn, each with a number value and a special effect that can either help or hinder. the challenge of this game is avoiding letting others learn the contents of your hand, as that is the easiest way to secure a rival’s elimination. there are no opportunities for temporary allegiances, meaning no one can be trusted at any time. instead, this game allows you to expose how your friends behave when smuggling the truth under pressure. verdict: this game has been tough to recommend to friends, despite it’s 5-15 minute playtime, because the rules don’t seem as easy as other compact experiences. but whenever i can convince a group to give it a go, it’s great for testing your mates’ poker faces, and fun for anyone who enjoys some simple sexy subterfuge. #x200b; **big - gloomhaven** this is a mammoth game that succeeds at taking players on a sprawling campaign featuring a unique and engaging selection of playable classes, varied yet easy-to-learn mechanics, and inventive ways of repurposing a vast core set of components. there are so many boards, props, minions, etc, that the game can be a challenge to setup and initially organise, but these many different parts ensure that no two games are the same. you are part of a guild trying to survive in the city of gloomhaven and the surrounding wilds. over the course of 100 or so missions (with objectives such as ‘kill all monsters on the board’ or ‘escort the npc from one corner of the board to another), players create and retire several characters as they follow a non-linear story in a world that gradually reveals itself. this is the closest thing to d’n’d in a box, without the need for a gm. the overarching player/character development feels like a video game as you upgrade abilities, make moral choices, and find more loot, while the main gameplay is a cross between cooperative card gaming and strategic turn-based combat. this is all confined to scenarios that individually won’t take more than an hour or two to complete, without requiring much commitment from occasional players. the story isn’t going to win any awards, but it is satisfyingly fun context for any guild of adventurers. verdict: i have invested more time into this game than any other, with more than half of the content remaining locked to me. if you can find a way to ease the process of setup, this is a game that you will want to bring back to the table to continue your adventures, with a flexibility of playtime that can last an entire day or just a couple of hours. #x200b;

Plus its a lot harder to get your friends to come over and play a point and click adventure together. I love when new developments happen in the case and just having all the locations and people out was really cool.

      "In recent years there has been a real interest in Japanese games. A number have been brought to the market in English editions, and that what has happened here with [**Long Live the Queen**](http://ludicreations.com/product/long-live-queen-classic-edition/). This clever two player game was originally published in Japan by Circle3D6. With the help of LudiCreations, it was finally brought to a wider audience with the help of a crowd-funded project that produced two editions: one that retained the Japanese art and theme, and a second version that used the diesel-punk theme of another LudiCreations game. There were other component changes as well, including larger tiles, a revised graphic design, plus expanded rules and some other new components that would help with the game-play. The result was a clever two-player game with a choice of two fine editions.  I opted to get the version with the Japanese styled art, so that's what I'll primarily be describing, but the game-play is identical with the diesel-punk version.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overview**\n",
      "\n",
      "In Long Live the Queen, two players go head-to-head in a tactical game where they each play one of the queen's two daughters. Now that the queen has died, we must seek to persuade the members of the court to support our quest to become the new queen. To do that, we need to cleverly make use of our court personnel.  Both players have a line of 11 face-down characters opposite each other, corresponding to the possible outcomes of rolling two standard dice. The dice then activate the characters: those corresponding to the rolled number are flipped face up, or their abilities trigger.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There are two different ways to win, either by being the first to get three of each prestige token, or by eliminating the opponent's princess.  Triggering the special abilities of our characters will get us the prestige we need in three main areas: might (red), wealth (yellow), and wisdom (blue). Alternatively, using our Assassin or Sniper on our competitor princess will also gain us victory. These two paths to victory are reasonably balanced, with a prestige win being more common, but your strategy will also depend on how your opponent plays.  In the inevitable tactical battle and see-saw struggle that will follow, will our princess come out on top, and become the next queen?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Impressions**\n",
      "\n",
      "LudiCreations have done an excellent job of bringing Long Live the Queen to English speaking audiences, and to a wider market. While coming up with a new theme and artwork, they have made the sensible choice of preserving the original anime style artwork as well, so that consumers can make their own choice about which they prefer. Certainly the components are excellent, with sturdy cardboard tiles and attractive dice being part of the package, along with wonderful artwork that I can't praise highly enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the game-play, it's a fine two player game which does exactly what it sets out to do, which is serve as a fast and highly tactical filler game with a light feel. Granted, it won't be everyone's cup of tea, and the amount of luck was the major reason why some didn't enjoy the game. Granted, the dice do play a significant role in determining the outcome - but that's to be expected in most games involving dice. But that doesn't mean that there are no meaningful decisions. The choices that you make, especially in how you arrange your characters, are still very important, and more often than not will determine the winner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each turn you also have opportunity to switch two of your adjacent tiles, or substitute which will be your \"Master\" ability that determines what your two \"Apprentice\" tiles do. So the overall positional set-up you opt for at the start of your game, and how you manipulate it during the game, is critical. The location of your Guard - which can protect your princess - is also very important. Two other very important tiles are the Assassin and Sniper, since these can take your opponent's characters out of action. Alternatively, you can focus on an income generating strategy that revolves around earning prestige chips before your opponent does. Whatever your strategy, it's certainly not purely random, because how your characters relate positionally with respect to each other and to your opponent will often prove decisive, even though you will still need to roll the right numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some players reported that the game dragged, and our first game felt like this a little too. But once you're familiar with the characters and their respective abilities, the game moves along quite nicely, and the length feels about right given how light the game actually is. Just try not to take too long about which characters to move at the end of your turn. You still need luck to be on your side to win, but clever play will make a difference. And given how quick the game can play, having the outcome influenced by luck is quite acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation**\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, Long Live the  Queen will especially please those looking for a light two player game, and who enjoy a sharply tactical and positional game with some secret information that gives scope for bluffing, while at the same time allowing a generous amount of luck courtesy of the dice. Imagine combining the positional feel of Chess, with the tactical bluffing of Stratego, and the dice rolling of Catan. Now wrap it all up into a gorgeous package with unique artwork, and give it the feel and length of a filler. That's effectively what you get with Long Live the Queen. I for one am very pleased that LudiCreations has helped bring this fun and fast two-player game out of Japan, and shared it with the rest of the world.\n",

      "After planning for a couple weeks, my friends and I finally played a print-and-play version of Blood on the Clocktower (BOTC) that I had put together. Given the hullabaloo about the SUSD review earlier this year, I figured I'd pitch in with my take on the game.\n",
      "A bit of background: My friends and I have played social deduction games, but it is definitely not our favorite genre by any means. We used to play The Resistance and One Night Ultimate Werewolf somewhat regularly, but those games fell out of fashion. In particular, we soured on The Resistance because there simply wasn’t enough actual information in the game to make it ‘interesting’. We now mostly play medium-ish games, some favorites being Ginkopolis, Inis, Not Alone, Scythe, Terraforming Mars, and Spirit Island. I mostly wanted to try BOTC due to the SUSD review – the idea of having that wonderful big group experience while still having logical, tactical deduction instead of shouting matches sounded wonderful.\n",

      "Most people had played Mafia or Werewolf before, so explaining the rules was fairly simple. On the first game, the good characters cautiously shared information, while the evil players generally kept quiet and offered tentative alibis. It was only when the supposed monk realized that they were drunk did everyone go ‘wait, what?’ and the game started to shine. From there, the lies and deceptions started to flow much more naturally. We played another game right after with me storytelling, and another game with a new storyteller right after that. The new storyteller was able to pick up the role without too much effort, and we had a brilliant game of second guessing ourselves with a baron in play.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After the initial 3 plays, we then played the game 5 times with almost the same group the next day. Everyone got much more comfortable with the different roles and at bluffing, although one person did get slightly flustered at being the imp three times in a row. But it was the last game that truly sold it for our group. The demon was about to be killed through a smart deception from the ravenkeeper, but the spy successfully planted the idea that a poisoner could be about. Her words caused the good team to frantically analyze any possibility of their previous assumptions being wrong. We wavered over which outsider was in play for 10 minutes. The supposed recluse almost burst a blood vessel after we spent so much time considering if there was a drunk. It finally ended when we finally decided on killing the demon, the good team collapsing in a group hug when the storyteller announced that good had triumphed. We spent the next 30 minutes exhilarated and exhausted, going over all the craziness that had happened. It was the kind of high that any player of a social deduction game dreams of.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s a bit hard to explain what feels different between BOTC and its older cousins, but I think the biggest change is the lack of player elimination. Everyone can be involved for the whole game, and everyone *wants* to be involved for the whole game because they have their own unique role. This also means that the whole group is wrapped up in the dramatic tension at the end of the game – no one except the storyteller knows exactly what is going on. The game length varied a bit, but in general they were about 30 minutes all included with 7 players. The quick game length was definitely a plus overall, since most people got to experience different parts of the game with their different roles.\n",

      "Lately I've been obsessed with the growing \"auto-battler\" trend popping up in the video game world.  In particular I really like the team-building/drafting mechanic. and got to wondering if it would work for a board (card) game.  My biggest concern is that the game would be prohibitively labor-intensive- too much micro-managing of gold, cards, and possibly experience points bogging down the fast-paced nature of the genre and becoming too much of a hassle.  So, for those of you who are familiar with the genre, would it work as a board game?  Are there any existing board games with similar mechanics?  How would you imagine the mechanics of an auto-battler transitioning to a card game?\n",

      "Most of my board game time in the past 10 years has been 2-player with my wife. Once we were introduced to Pandemic, co-op games have been our bread and butter. We'll mix in the occasional game of Terraforming Mars or Concordia, but co-op games seem to be the ideal game for many couples - and we fit that mold. We've had a lot of enjoyment lately playing co-op deck builders in particular, so I thought I'd share what we've learned so far. I'll talk about these games roughly from least to most favorite. There are a couple of games in this list that might not fit the definition exactly, but this is my post, so I'll do what I want.\n",
      "\n",
      "First up is **Shadowrun: Crossfire** (10 plays). This game has the structure of a great deck builder, but fails in the execution. I really liked the theme - the mix of futuristic tech and magic was very cool (I understand there is a Shadowrun universe, but I know nothing about it). The game had some neat little elements - a campaign like structure where you can earn perks to make your character stronger, which allows you to attempt harder missions.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's failings were critical for us, however. Lots of co-op games are swingy because of card draw, but S:C pretty much takes the cake. You can have insta-lose right away due to bad card draw, or you can feel good about yourself and then get massacred in one turn. I like my co-ops hard, but reasonably so - I don't want to have to grind out the same mission over and over to gain perks. It's a board game, not a video game.\n",
      "\n",
      "*You might like this if*: you like losing a lot, you love the Shadowrun universe, insta-lose is your friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle** (20 plays) is an interesting one. This game is the best bad game I've every played. As a family of Harry Potter fanatics, buying this game was a no-brainer, but my expectations were low. Once we got into it, we found numerous things that we loved, and just as many that we hated. Essentially, it is a great game that is fundamentally broken. You can read [my specific thoughts here](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8bqqyz/harry_potter_hogwarts_battle_is_the_best_bad_game/), but to sum up: 1. Poor player count scaling, 2. No categories/tiers of villains or cards, 3. The Spiral of Death.\n",
      "\n",
      "But on the plus side, it's got some really good mechanics that incorporate everything you love from the Harry Potter universe. (If you're interested, here's a link to my [post about house rules for the game](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8bziei/harry_potter_hogwarts_battle_house_rules/).)\n",
      "\n",
      "*You might like this if*: you love Harry Potter.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Shadowrift** (5 plays), is my newest find in the co-op deck builder category. You should take my comments with a grain of salt because A) I've only played 5 times, and B) There is a revised 2nd Edition I've never seen (I acquired a 1st edition copy). In this game you are heroes defending a town from invading monsters, who apparently are coming in through a rift. You can win by either building walls around the town, or sealing the rifts. There are a couple of clever mechanics in this game, notably the Town and Traveler cards. Instead of just having a town with health points, you are actually constructing a deck of townspeople by hiring villagers to join the town. On your turn, you can use the abilities of the townsfolk to assist you in your fight. However, when the monsters kill someone in the town, they are replaced by Corpses, which (as you may guess) aren't great.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a neat take on the genre, and I like the decision space it provides for you. There is a variable market of cards to buy from, and the base game comes with 5 (6?) enemies to fight. Overall, it's an entertaining game with more good than bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest issue I've had with the game is that you mix one Shadowrift per player into the monster deck of 20 cards. When those pop up makes a huge difference in winning. Too early and the game is a cake walk, too late and you might not survive. But compared to some of the other games, that issue isn't a game breaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would absolutely recommend trying to grab a copy in a trade on the cheap (heck, there's even a [copy available for $1 plus shipping](https://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/product/1880465) right now). I understand that there's a 2nd Edition with expansions and more content, but the price tag seems high to me. I'm expecting to get 20+ plays out of it and then move it in a trade. I don't see it as a long term game without more content.\n",
      "\n",
      "*You might like this if*: you want to play around with an interesting shared deck mechanic, you like trying out fun new games that won't take over your life\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, speaking of taking over your life, let's talk about **Legendary: Marvel** (10 plays). I'm just going to lump all the flavors of Legendary together and call them Legendary: Marvel. There is a huge amount of content in the Legendary game universe, so you can explore it as deeply as you wish. Essentially every game you have a starting hand, there is a random market of cards, there are villains, and there's a big bad to fight. Every fight is slightly different due to the various mechanics brought to the table by your setup. Every game I've played of this has been enjoyable but not spectacular. In general it's a well tuned system that feels just a bit too sterile to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend owns lots of content for this game, and we always joke that playing Legendary is 3 games in 1. Game 1: Assemble the cards, Game 2: Play the game, Game 3: Sort all the cards and put everything away again.\n",

      "*You might like this if*: you love the IP, you have an organization fetish\n",

      "Now, before you yell at me that **Sentinels of the Multiverse** (12 plays) isn't a deck builder, let me just say this: You're correct. However, it feels so much like these other games that I feel it is legal to include this in the list. If you are looking for a co-op deck builder to play, SotM might be the game you love. Sentinels has a few amazing things going for it, and one big downside. The positives first: Awesome theme - just a wonderful comic book world that you get to play in. Great decks - instead of building a deck as you go, each hero has their own pre-constructed deck. And boy does each deck play differently. You get a real sense of how each hero is a different character by what they can do with their cards. Super quick to set up - grab hero decks, bad guy deck, environment deck, and your tokens. Bam! Ready to play.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did I say \"tokens\"? Ah, yes, to the negative - saying that Sentinels is a bit fiddly is like saying Campaign for North Africa runs a bit long. I'm getting ready to attack and I have a +1 Damage token on my guy, and there's another +1 Damage token ... is that for me, or only when attacking the Environment? Wait, why is that +1 Damage Taken token there? Did the card that brought that into play get discarded or not? What type of damage did he do? Am I immune to fire or not?\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not insurmountable, and it definitely gets easier with multiple plays, but managing the tokens and health is a barrier to enjoying the game. If that sounds frustrating, don't even try this game. But if you can get over that hurdle, Sentinels offers some truly great experiences with very fun, thematic cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "*You might like this if*: you like superheroes, cool combos, and are fine with fiddly mechanics\n",
      "\n",
      "So, you thought I was cheating with Sentinels? How about this - my next game is **Orleans: Invasion** (20 plays), a game that doesn't even have cards! Before you string me up by my meeples, hear me out: Orleans is a bag builder, and a bag builder is simply a modified deck builder. I'm including it because I find this game definitely scratches some of the same itches of the other games on this list. You're working together, building up an engine, trying to beat the Big Bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to play the cooperative version of Orleans, you need the base game plus The Invasion expansion. On the one hand, that's a relatively big investment; on the other hand, you also have the exceptional base game of Orleans to play. The Invasion expansion does a masterful job of turning a purely competitive game into a cooperative experience. Each player gets their own role which requires them to achieve different goals along with the group goals. The roles change every game, and the random events change, so the puzzle is different every time. Difficulty can easily be scaled up or down. We have had numerous games that came down to the last turn, which is exactly what I want in a co-op.\n",
      "\n",
      "*You might like this if*: you like bag building, you like Orleans\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm saving the best for last, so it's time for **Aeon's End** (150+ plays). I won't deny that I'm a fanboy. Aeon's End has marched all the way up to be my #1 favorite game of all time. I own all content, and backed the latest Kickstarter. So at least you know where I'm coming from here.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Aeon's End, you play mages who are trying to defend Gravehold from an attacking Nemesis. The primary strength of AE is the incredible variability you get with the different types of Mages, Nemeses, and market cards. Every game feels unique and different - a mage that might work well against one Nemesis could fall flat against a different one. My wife and I like to do a completely randomized setup, and then tweak it if we end up in a battle we can't win.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mechanically, Aeon's End is a finely tuned machine. The vast majority of the games we've played have been entertaining and close. You feel like you're getting stronger, which is good because you know the minions get stronger as well. The Nemesis deck is built in tiers. Each Nemesis has their own unique cards, and those are mixed in with a random collection of basic cards. These are stacked with the easiest tier on top. The criticism could be: \"It takes longer to set up.\" However, I will take a slightly longer setup time that gives me a better overall experience instead of the insta-lose games you can have with HP:HB or Shadowrun. And you are rarely put in a no-win situation. Even games where we lose in the mid-game are winnable with a strategy change. Most of the time we just reset the game and give it another go.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, Aeon's End is simply cool. You have to open breaches to create more space to play more spells. You choose between gems, relics, and spells to buy to get the perfect deck. You can also charge up the special ability that only your mage has. The pace, flow, and feel of the game just sing for me. (Important note: I vastly prefer AE at 2P over 3 or 4. I just feel you get more powerful and can do more cool things at the lower player count.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, there are two important mechanics to mention. 1. A deck builder with no shuffling. It's a cool thing, because this game expects you to pack your discard pile to get powerful combos. It adds interesting decisions on when to buy a card, or when to hold cards in your hand for the next turn. 2. Variable turn order. At 2P, everybody (each mage and the Nemesis) get 2 turn order cards. Those 6 cards are shuffled and flipped to determine who goes when. It makes a procedural game more dynamic. This brings up another common complaint of AE: \"You can win or lose depending on how the turn order deck was shuffled!\" Often times that's true, but I love it - and if you end up losing, there was probably something better you could have done earlier to put yourself in a better position.\n",

      "most of my board game time in the past 10 year ha been 2-player with my wife. once we were introduced to pandemic, co-op game have been our bread and butter. we'll mix in the occasional game of terraforming mar or concordia, but co-op game seem to be the ideal game for many couple - and we fit that mold. we've had a lot of enjoyment lately playing co-op deck builder in particular, so i thought i'd share what we've learned so far. i'll talk about these game roughly from least to most favorite. there are a couple of game in this list that might not fit the definition exactly, but this is my post, so i'll do what i want. first up is **shadowrun: crossfire** (10 plays). this game ha the structure of a great deck builder, but fails in the execution. i really liked the theme - the mix of futuristic tech and magic wa very cool (i understand there is a shadowrun universe, but i know nothing about it). the game had some neat little element - a campaign like structure where you can earn perk to make your character stronger, which allows you to attempt harder missions. it's failing were critical for us, however. lot of co-op game are swingy because of card draw, but s:c pretty much take the cake. you can have insta-lose right away due to bad card draw, or you can feel good about yourself and then get massacred in one turn. i like my co-op hard, but reasonably so - i don't want to have to grind out the same mission over and over to gain perks. it's a board game, not a video game. *you might like this if*: you like losing a lot, you love the shadowrun universe, insta-lose is your friend. **harry potter: hogwarts battle** (20 plays) is an interesting one. this game is the best bad game i've every played. a a family of harry potter fanatics, buying this game wa a no-brainer, but my expectation were low. once we got into it, we found numerous thing that we loved, and just a many that we hated. essentially, it is a great game that is fundamentally broken. you can read [my specific thought here]() right now). i understand that there's a 2nd edition with expansion and more content, but the price tag seems high to me. i'm expecting to get 20+ play out of it and then move it in a trade. i don't see it a a long term game without more content. *you might like this if*: you want to play around with an interesting shared deck mechanic, you like trying out fun new game that won't take over your life well, speaking of taking over your life, let's talk about **legendary: marvel** (10 plays). i'm just going to lump all the flavor of legendary together and call them legendary: marvel. there is a huge amount of content in the legendary game universe, so you can explore it a deeply a you wish. essentially every game you have a starting hand, there is a random market of cards, there are villains, and there's a big bad to fight. every fight is slightly different due to the various mechanic brought to the table by your setup. every game i've played of this ha been enjoyable but not spectacular. in general it's a well tuned system that feel just a bit too sterile to me. my friend owns lot of content for this game, and we always joke that playing legendary is 3 game in 1. game 1: assemble the cards, game 2: play the game, game 3: sort all the card and put everything away again. *you might like this if*: you love the ip, you have an organization fetish now, before you yell at me that **sentinels of the multiverse** (12 plays) isn't a deck builder, let me just say this: you're correct. however, it feel so much like these other game that i feel it is legal to include this in the list. if you are looking for a co-op deck builder to play, sotm might be the game you love. sentinel ha a few amazing thing going for it, and one big downside. the positive first: awesome theme - just a wonderful comic book world that you get to play in. great deck - instead of building a deck a you go, each hero ha their own pre-constructed deck. and boy doe each deck play differently. you get a real sense of how each hero is a different character by what they can do with their cards. super quick to set up - grab hero decks, bad guy deck, environment deck, and your tokens. bam! ready to play. did i say \"tokens\"? ah, yes, to the negative - saying that sentinel is a bit fiddly is like saying campaign for north africa run a bit long. i'm getting ready to attack and i have a +1 damage token on my guy, and there's another +1 damage token ... is that for me, or only when attacking the environment? wait, why is that +1 damage taken token there? did the card that brought that into play get discarded or not? what type of damage did he do? am i immune to fire or not? it's not insurmountable, and it definitely get easier with multiple plays, but managing the token and health is a barrier to enjoying the game. if that sound frustrating, don't even try this game. but if you can get over that hurdle, sentinel offer some truly great experience with very fun, thematic cards. *you might like this if*: you like superheroes, cool combos, and are fine with fiddly mechanic so, you thought i wa cheating with sentinels? how about this - my next game is **orleans: invasion** (20 plays), a game that doesn't even have cards! before you string me up by my meeples, hear me out: orleans is a bag builder, and a bag builder is simply a modified deck builder. i'm including it because i find this game definitely scratch some of the same itch of the other game on this list. you're working together, building up an engine, trying to beat the big bad. in order to play the cooperative version of orleans, you need the base game plus the invasion expansion. on the one hand, that's a relatively big investment; on the other hand, you also have the exceptional base game of orleans to play. the invasion expansion doe a masterful job of turning a purely competitive game into a cooperative experience. each player get their own role which requires them to achieve different goal along with the group goals. the role change every game, and the random event change, so the puzzle is different every time. difficulty can easily be scaled up or down. we have had numerous game that came down to the last turn, which is exactly what i want in a co-op. *you might like this if*: you like bag building, you like orleans i'm saving the best for last, so it's time for **aeon's end** (150+ plays). i won't deny that i'm a fanboy. aeon's end ha marched all the way up to be my #1 favorite game of all time. i own all content, and backed the latest kickstarter. so at least you know where i'm coming from here. in aeon's end, you play mages who are trying to defend gravehold from an attacking nemesis. the primary strength of ae is the incredible variability you get with the different type of mages, nemeses, and market cards. every game feel unique and different - a mage that might work well against one nemesis could fall flat against a different one. my wife and i like to do a completely randomized setup, and then tweak it if we end up in a battle we can't win. mechanically, aeon's end is a finely tuned machine. the vast majority of the game we've played have been entertaining and close. you feel like you're getting stronger, which is good because you know the minion get stronger a well. the nemesis deck is built in tiers. each nemesis ha their own unique cards, and those are mixed in with a random collection of basic cards. these are stacked with the easiest tier on top. the criticism could be: \"it take longer to set up.\" however, i will take a slightly longer setup time that give me a better overall experience instead of the insta-lose game you can have with hp:hb or shadowrun. and you are rarely put in a no-win situation. even game where we lose in the mid-game are winnable with a strategy change. most of the time we just reset the game and give it another go. and, aeon's end is simply cool. you have to open breach to create more space to play more spells. you choose between gems, relics, and spell to buy to get the perfect deck. you can also charge up the special ability that only your mage has. the pace, flow, and feel of the game just sing for me. (important note: i vastly prefer ae at 2p over 3 or 4. i just feel you get more powerful and can do more cool thing at the lower player count.) finally, there are two important mechanic to mention. 1. a deck builder with no shuffling. it's a cool thing, because this game expects you to pack your discard pile to get powerful combos. it add interesting decision on when to buy a card, or when to hold card in your hand for the next turn. 2. variable turn order. at 2p, everybody (each mage and the nemesis) get 2 turn order cards. those 6 card are shuffled and flipped to determine who go when. it make a procedural game more dynamic. this brings up another common complaint of ae: \"you can win or lose depending on how the turn order deck wa shuffled!\" often time that's true, but i love it - and if you end up losing, there wa probably something better you could have done earlier to put yourself in a better position. so there we go. way too much text about co-op deckbuilders. i'd love to hear if anybody ha other game they've played and would recommend. i've got a couple on my want in trade list, so hopefully they'll make it to my table at some point."

      "\n",
      "This game is kind of a slow burn. It’s not face paced, intense action or combat. It is interactive story telling reminiscent of when I read choose your own adventure books as a kid, which is exactly what they were going for. The exploration in this game is so much fun. Every time I get to a new tile, there’s so much I can do. And each choice usually is followed by another either/or decision that can have beneficial or damning consequences. I can craft equipment to help me along, but doing so might eventually cost me unless I’m being smart about how I use my resources. Each gamble I take on following a new path could ultimately leave me sick, hurt, or worse, dead. But the payoff is worth it when I’m rewarded with life-saving medicine, or a weapon to combat danger, or that ever important flame to keep hope alive. \n",
      "\n",
      "The game just tells the narrative so well with such little information presented on the board. Each section of terrain usually has a small piece of story attached to it, with each action also furthering the storyline as your progress. Plus, there’s so many different expansions now that this will have me entertained for a long time trying to get through each one. Granted, I’m sure there will be some slight overlap in cards because after all, there is a finite number in the game of certain options, however the way it is crafted, I doubt this will matter much as the way in which the situation presents will be completely different from any time it has presented before due to circumstance, progression, and game state. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only downside I could see is replay ability eventually running out or growing slightly stale. The first play through everything is new and there’s so many options to explore, you can’t possibly hope to hit all of them. Even if you decide to play through the same story a second and third time I could see it playing out differently because of card mechanics and choices. Eventually, however, it will exhaust itself to where you know all the results and by that point, I will have gotten my money’s worth several times over and I’ll only be too happy to part with the game to let someone else enjoy it for the first time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Group play is great, but it can get a little mucked up because there isn’t really a turn order dynamic and so quarterback or dominant players can often times take over or steamroll decisions, but if you have a solid play group that can work together, the game is a blast to explore with a group. However, solo it definitely shines. It’s one of those games in my collection where when I have a spare hour or two, I can break it out and just enjoy working through the story and seeing where it takes me. The *Save* mechanic that the game incorporates for keeping track of progress as well as easy break down and setup is great. It also becomes part of the story, in which there will be cases where you’ll have to rest and save in order to trigger certain events and replenish certain resources. It’s all just brilliantly designed. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I just cannot sing the praises of this game enough. I know it’s a little tough to find, but if you manage to get your hands on a copy or have the chance to, I highly recommend checking it out as it is an incredible narrative gaming experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "Plus, the company is so awesome that due to a printing hiccup the first time around, some of the card sizes were misprinted/miscut, and the company resent the proper sized cards to replace the initial run, free of charge. I’m sure that wasn’t cheap, but it was greatly appreciated. The customer service is top notch. I had the pleasure of meeting the designers/creators at GenCon50, who walked me through a play through of the game and were extremely nice, personable, and passionate. They also have a Kickstarter I think coming next year for their next entry in the choose your own adventure style gameplay called 7th Citadel I think?

      "Champions of Midgard is a middleweight, Viking-themed, worker placement game with dice rolling in which players are leaders of Viking clans who have traveled to an embattled Viking harbor town to help defend it against the threat of trolls, draugr, and other mythological Norse beasts. By defeating these epic creatures, players gain glory and the favor of the gods. When the game ends, the player who has earned the most glory earns the title of Jarl and is recognized as a champion of Midgard!\n",
      "\n",
      "Placing workers allows for the collection of resources and warriors, which players may then send on journeys to neighboring villages or across the sea to defeat monsters and gain the glory they need for victory. Resources are used to carve runes, build ships, and feed your followers. Viking warriors (custom dice) do battle with the myriad enemies the town faces.\n",

      "Hi Guys, \n",
      "So I have been into board-gaming for over a year now, and like most people, it wasn’t long into my plunge that I came across the world of Kickstarter games. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am a backer on one game. And thus the SHOCK!!! \n",
      "I know this is common knowledge by now, but how it is okay that it has become a norm to deliver KS games 3/6 months late? \n",
      "\n",
      "I may sound critical here, but I am not actually that kind of person. Like I understand there can be unfortunate events out of the publishers control. But that’s different to what appears to me to be a norm where people order games expecting them to be late, not by a month but by 3 months or more. \n",
      "\n",
      "Like I have backed Eclipse: 2nd Dawn, and I was one of the many backers new the this world who wondered why it wasn’t coming when they said it would. I was shocked to find threads on BGG of new backers rightfully upset, and and older veterans comforting the newer guys by saying that MOST KS projects are in-fact 3/4 months late. \n",
      "\n",
      "And again, I realize that KS is for bringing projects to life that wouldn’t otherwise be viable. And so if KS had one or two board-gaming projects and these were late, then that would be totally understandable. But you would think after having been a platform for thousands of games that publishers would have come to a realistic knowledge of how long a given game will take. And yet this isn’t the case. \n",
      "\n",
      "So my question is, isn’t this at some point a lie to the customer, making us believe it will come in March, when actually they really know that’s unrealistic and it will actually only come in August?  Why can’t they just be more honest with the expectations they create? \n",
      "\n",
      "I am still very excited about my game, and I am probably going to back another game on KS, but it feels good get this off my chest. And in my opinion I highly regard publishers who deliver on time because it shows me a sense of integrity and commitment.\n",

I’ll typically have one or two downloaded to kill some time while I’m away from home, but if I’m really trying to game, I’m definitely set up at my PC. This was true, until my friends and I downloaded The Battle of Polytopia. A 4X style of game (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate) Polytopia is similar to the Civilization series, but simplified to make it more approachable for those who are new to the genre. But don’t let that make you think that the game is any less fun; especially when you get a game going with a group of your friends, you will find yourself turning on your phone more often than your computer.\n",

Unfortunately I couldn’t be excited about winning because I was too glad that it was just finally over. Which is disappointing because I’m a huge fan of the genre and I used to be a huge fan of the Civ series. As I played through my first game of Polytopia, I was refreshed by how they captured all of the fun that 4X genre can offer but managed to do it in a way that made Civilization 5 look like Quantum Physics.\n",

Controlling your units, building up your cities, and battling your enemies is all extremely easy to navigate. Because of this simplified system, the 4 X’s (Exploring, Expanding, Exploiting, and Exterminating) are allowed to take the forefront and are not hidden behind a giant wall of scary buttons and levers. The graphics pair perfectly with this simplified system. The minimalist art design, bright colors and cute little characters combine to create a world worth conquering.\n",

If you have a group of friends who all like to play games together, this $0.99 is one of the cheapest ways to add a great multiplayer game to your repertoire. The online play is very well-tuned. Adding your friends and getting a game going is painless. The turn-based system gives you the freedom to not be stuck at your phone through the whole game and the quick turns help keep the game moving.

Sometimes, the most fun that games can offer isn't in extensive gameplay, but just some fun and simple gameplay enjoyed with friends. Well done, Midjiwan.

      "hello all, although i worked on different game project in the past few year whenever i get some time from the busy life, however number go! is the first game ever that i wa able to finish and then publish it on google playstore and apple appstore. while i really want my game to be a hit :), being my first published game, i consider it a an opportunity for me to learn and experience what it take to be a successful indie game developer. and that is why looking for feedback from others. some feature of the game: 1. it is a simple, addictive game that you can play at any time, while on your way to office/school on bus, in a car pool (of course not while driving :-)) or train. the gameplay is very minimalist and require only a single finger to play. 2. quick to get into and get out of the game. you can play it while waiting at the airport, doctor's clinic etc. where when needed you can simply get out of the game without effecting your gameplay or score. 3. i have tried to design the game in a way to minimize the battery consumption. this wa very important for me because i really wanted the user to play game for long time without worrying about the battery life. 4. there are 5000+ unique puzzles. the design of the each puzzle pack is such that the difficulty level increase gradually. once you unlock daily challenges, then you will also receive 5 unique challenging puzzle daily. 5. there are several achievement in the game which you can achieve once you complete certain tasks/challenges or level packs. there are also two leaderboards: one overall player ranking and the other is the daily challenge ranking. using those leaderboards, you can compete against your friend and other people. the faster you complete a level, the higher score you get. if you are interested in trying the game and providing feedback, please search \"number go!\" in apple appstore and google playstore. thanks. .png\n",

      "There was this mobile game I really enjoyed, and it was called something but I don’t remember what it is. It’s a game with an art style similar to badlands where you are a small, square-shaped ninja that mainly moves with your swiping on the screen. You collect a currency called “souls” and as you progress you get new abilities and enemies along with dangerous obstacles start spawning. You have to move as much as possible because you are being chased by a wall of red saw blades through a randomly generated map. You can unlock new skins which are randomly acquired from a portal you activate with souls. I remember everything about the game, but I just don’t know it’s name\n",

Easy idle gameplay does not need you to play all day and force you to speed money to get strong, which makes the game truly entertained rather than a burden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Idle with rich gameplay.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a casual idle mobile game, Taptap heroes is very rich in gameplay. With the regular idling mode, players can acquire equipment and upgrade levels. As the player level increases, the game will unlock guild, arena, expedition, planet trials, etc. Whether upgrading material acquisition or fighting with other players, or participating in the guild construction and growing up with friends from all over the world, players can meet different needs and experience loads of fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most important thing is that all this does not require the players to \"spend tons of money.\" One of the characteristics of the idle game is that even if you are offline, you can still receive experience and equipment. Players only need to open the game in their free time to collect offline idle loots to get a variety of resource materials. They can enjoy the game freely! At the same time, all the resources in the game can be obtained through normal game play, and it is not necessary to speed money but players can freely enjoy the game fun rather than a burden!\n",

      "\n",
      "In addition to the hero itself, there are many ways players can increase their combat power, such as the improvement of the overall attributes of Aura and the wonderful chemical reactions of various hero combinations. A reasonable lineup should have tank/output/heal, but in the Taptap heroes, it also allows you to develop more novel combinations, such as a violent combination with full of output, or tank and Cleric composed of the Great Wall.\n",

      "I used to play this game on an iPad I used to have. Its basically another infinite runner/dodging game but the presentation was low-poly and minimalistic and the sense of speed was actually breakneck fast, or at least it felt that way. It had a punchy title and the letters in the title were used as different level of difficulty, each with their own perks. The game has lanes that you can swipe between. You usually have to dodge white blocks but in later difficulties there are green blocks, which you have to run into, and blue blocks, which depending on which side the arrow is pointing to, you have to avoid the block by switching lanes to that side. The game also had an incredible cyberpunk soundtrack. I wish i remmebered the titles. Please help me find this game. Thanks.\n",

      "Hello, me and my frinend cant remember the game we used to play. We were playing it about 5-6 years back. There were different levels and different arenas where you could fight hordes of different type of zombies and even bosses. There were graveyard arena, snowy arena or grassy arena with lake in the middle. You could pick up many weapons (pistol, assault rifle, smg, light machine gun, you could have them in dual form) including melee weapons like sword or katana and all of them were upgradable. They were dropped on the ground in crates and you could always see what type of weapon you were going to get. You could play as different characters but i dont know if ther was any different than their look. I am grateful for every comment. \n",
