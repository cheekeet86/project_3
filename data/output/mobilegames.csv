160,t3_bzpv3j,"rant about mobile game companies, especially playgendary",11,"tomb of the mask. a very popular mobile game that wa advertised a lot. made by playgendary. when you open the game, the first thing they show you is a three day trial for their subscription. it remove ads, give you some coins, give you unlimited energy(keep playing it a long a you want without paying extra) and it give you 4 skins. well, guess how much the subscription is after the trial. 8.49€ per week! that's over 440€ a year! fucking hell. and with the free trial they're clearly intending this. 1. kid see trial and asks mom to use her credit card for it 2. kid play it maybe for a week or two, then forgets about it, subscription keep going. 3. profit that's fucking shady. 440€ per year is not a reasonable price for some extra thing in a free game. yes, they do offer cheaper plans(for example a one year plan for 104€, but it doesn't have a free trial and they barely advertise it. you really have to look for it) the game ha over 50 million downloads. if even a small percentage of those forgot a subscription, they still make a shit ton of money on top of that they also have ads, powerups, skins, lootboxes, in-game currency and an energy counter that let you keep playing if you pay. feel free to spread the message, i think we need to bring more attention to this. other company do this too."

247,t3_c97p95,"old game like ff mobius, brave frontier, etc. give too much, lowering difficulty",2,"what i mean by this is if these are old enough, they give new player better stuff than if you were to get the game when it first came out. for example, ff mobius, when i played the game again, it offered a starter pack for 3 summoning ticket (pretty cheap). what i got wa a job that raised my attack stat up to around 200 to 800. it also gave me 5 rank 5 abilities. this remove any difficulty i have in the beginning levels. for brave frontier or similar games, i wa given so many free gem for things, like apologizes for errors, or random event i wasn't even there for. this allowed me to summon a bunch of people/monsters, and not only that, i always got high level monsters. sometimes if i use a already existing account at low rank/level, the same thing happens. stuff like this lower the fun a bit or a lot depending on the game. a want a little struggle. doe anyone else think the same thing?"

253,t3_cef5km,help me find this game!,3,it is a town building game with blocky graphics. your town is on a hill and it tile based. you start on top of the hill and you have to unlock the level below. each level ha more tile than the previous. please help me find this game. i last plaied it a couple of year ago and it’s free.
254,t3_ce0rqb,suggestion a to the identity of this horror game?,7,"so, a bit of backstory. a few year ago, i had seen a person playing this game and had watched them do a nearly full playthrough of it. i had been fascinated by it at the time and searching for it ever since to no avail. #x200b; **content summary** the game i'm looking for wa a mobile horror/psychological horror game, with a sort of alternate reality plot. the art style of the game wa very reminiscent of game like my lovely daughter, fran bow, sally face, the like, a lot of line shading and detailed stylistic choices. most of the character design were animal-based, especially with their heads. most memorable would be a deer/elk/caribou-looking creature in a black cape and an overly detailed horse head on a rather humanoid, clothed body. there wa a rather convoluted plot, but well-written. the core of it from what i can remember wa your being in some form of whimsical wintery fantasy underworld, guarded by some form of powerful animal protectors. i know a number of key events, too. there wa a plot line where you had to give four dead baby to a horse in a river in order to fuse their soul into a light source for a dark brick hall area, after which the horse drowns and the river turn to blood. there's a portion where you have to follow the voice of a singing woman, who then turn horrific and then kill you. finally, the ending of the game is hidden in the official guide, where you find a year, then get four symbols, then you unlock the end in the actual game itself. i believe the name began with a p. can anyone help me find out what this game is called or where i can find it? edit: added fran bow"

[i would love for you to view the original post with all of it's medium here](), but if you want to stay right here, i will put the text below. cheers! nbsp; *** nbsp; i’ve never been one to play game on my phone. i’ll typically have one or two downloaded to kill some time while i’m away from home, but if i’m really trying to game, i’m definitely set up at my pc. this wa true, until my friend and i downloaded the battle of polytopia. a 4x style of game (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate) polytopia is similar to the civilization series, but simplified to make it more approachable for those who are new to the genre. but don’t let that make you think that the game is any le fun; especially when you get a game going with a group of your friends, you will find yourself turning on your phone more often than your computer. nbsp; we stumbled upon polytopia at a good time: i had just finished a game of civ 5 and found myself overwhelmed by how long it had took. after a staggering 450 turn i had finally won the game. unfortunately i couldn’t be excited about winning because i wa too glad that it wa just finally over. which is disappointing because i’m a huge fan of the genre and i used to be a huge fan of the civ series. a i played through my first game of polytopia, i wa refreshed by how they captured all of the fun that 4x genre can offer but managed to do it in a way that made civilization 5 look like quantum physics. nbsp; the mechanic were very easy to pick up. there’s a small learning curve (as there is in almost every game) but while you are learning, you are still able to enjoy the process. controlling your units, building up your cities, and battling your enemy is all extremely easy to navigate. because of this simplified system, the 4 x’s (exploring, expanding, exploiting, and exterminating) are allowed to take the forefront and are not hidden behind a giant wall of scary button and levers. the graphic pair perfectly with this simplified system. the minimalist art design, bright color and cute little character combine to create a world worth conquering. nbsp; the aspect that absolutely took this game to the next level wa the online play. while completely free to download and play offline (either against bot or with other people in the room), to play online, they do require you to spend $0.99 on one of the “tribes” in order to help them keep the server running. if you have a group of friend who all like to play game together, this $0.99 is one of the cheapest way to add a great multiplayer game to your repertoire. the online play is very well-tuned. adding your friend and getting a game going is painless. the turn-based system give you the freedom to not be stuck at your phone through the whole game and the quick turn help keep the game moving. once you get the game going, they will quickly create some fierce competition for you and your friend to enjoy. nbsp; for a mobile game, midjiwan absolutely captured the essence of what’s important. it's easy to navigate on the mobile platform. the control are fluid and work consistently. it's approachable. everyone from hardcore gamers to someone who isn't a gamer at all can join in on the fun. you can easily play with friends. sometimes, the most fun that game can offer isn't in extensive gameplay, but just some fun and simple gameplay enjoyed with friends. well done, midjiwan. i’m excited to see what you all have in store next!"

558,t3_97tjn0,a fair warning for new players: hero academy 2,1,"from what many of u member of the official discord server can gather, the game is not going to receive future addition or even balance patches: **what you see know is what you are getting for, and nothing else**. this is based on stuff that persisted for over three months: **. the** **completely lack of response from the devs to people calling the game ""dead""** (which is info you would never want to get spread and would immediately argue against if it where not the case, or at least state that the devs can't release the information regarding that yet, or at least say something, anything, instead of dead silence); **. the completely lack of balancing patches** or any meaningful response to it despite a lot of people - even top player - asking for it repeatedly (cards like the boar and overpopulate come to mind). **. no future expansion possibility even hinted** by the devs. the card you can get here in the game so far are realistically the only card you will get. the above point make for a stale (or stable, if you want a more positive outlook on the matter) gameplay, since there isn't any factor that will push it to change. **if you don't care for that**, if you can have fun only with the card that the game currently ha and the card balance it has, and if you judge that fun can last long enough to warrant buying pack and stuff with real money, than sure, go ahead. i just wanted to give a fair warning for those who enjoy a evolving game in term of collection, strategy, mechanic and such. if you don't aim for that, like i said, **it should be reasonable to buy some stuff. otherwise, you definitely are going to have a bad time if you do that, specially if you have a tight budget for game and entertainment**"

655,t3_9ngur9,looking for this fps with swipe movement control,1,"i played this early access fps for a while. basically it wa set in the future where you (the player) would fight alien that shoot at you. but the thing that kept me hooked were the controls. instead of classic joystick and shoot button, you had to swipe to turn and tap to move to a specific preset point. the shooting wa interesting cause you had to tap at the enemy and you would shoot. the strategic thing about the game wa that you had to plan your attack and shoot at the enemy's that fired first or were the most dangerous. the weapon in the game consists of the main gun and pistol. the part of the gun and pistol were customizable, with each part yeilding different stats. these part were unlocked in crates. another cool thing about the customization wa that when you changed the part of the gun, the new piece would be of a different aesthetic. like a different color and design. if you got all the part to a specific design you could literally re-create the gun into something totally different. this wa the same for the armor customization too. each part had unique stats with different part that could be equipped. i remember there wa jump boot that could be equipped to make the character jump really high. if you have any idea of what this game is i'd like to know, thanks in advance!"

785,t3_ad80g7,age of strategy review (5/5 stars),5,"this review is on the mobile app game age of strategy, if i had to give a brief description of the game i'd say it is like fire emblem and a 8 bit version of sid meier's civilization. it's a free game and is easy to get the hang of if your aren't the biggest into the game listed above. the game is very well done and the developer is quite active and is good about responding to email and is open to suggestion to make the game better. the game itself go into depth, from it large selection of unit to it many upgrade that add content to the game. you can build building (from archery ranges, to castles) and research technology to better your unit in game. the upgrade themselves cost gem to get,but you can get them multiple ways, like donating to the developer for example. you don't have to do that, the game includes ton of campaign that have a lot of map and you can earn more gem then you will ever need for the game. the game also includes a multiplayer function online and local or you can play against bots, the ai in the game is pretty good. you can choose to create a profile if you want (needed for online play). one of my personal favorite part of the game is the map created (also requires profile), but if you have a created map and think it would be good a a map in general for the game talk to the developer and a long a the map is balanced there is a possibility it can be added a a random map for non-campaign use, or it can be added a a map you can download along with many other map made by member of the community, another thing i've noticed is if you make a map and it's put into the game itself the developer make sure to give you credit, i've even seen campaign made by community members. like all game it ha it ups and downs, like multiplayer match can last for day and if someone forgets about the game you started and doesn't take their turn well you are stuck from what i've heard, but i haven't had that problem yet. sometime you will wait hour for your turn but you got to understand you could be playing with some on the other side of the world. overall the game is well balanced among the unit and is updated often, you can even go back and look through the version log (that will tell you all about the fix and added content). me personally would give the game a 10/10, but don't take my word for it check it out yourself, you might be surprised. well that's about it for my review on age of strategy thanks for reading. hope this helped"

802,t3_akag4u,spelling go! a unique spelling bee word puzzle game to improve your english vocabulary,1,"hello all, when i wa a small child, i used to learn by heart spelling of different word by writing them multiple times. but it wa not fun. i wanted to make learning different word some what fun for children. so i decided to work on ""spelling go!"" game which i am launching on google playstore and apple appstore on 1st feb 2019. i wanted child to learn different word in a way that excite them or at least challenge them to to learn more and more. and not a boring repetitive process of writing them multiple time on a piece of paper. this i think what ""spelling go!"" accomplishes. in this spelling bee word puzzle game, you are presented with scattered letter on a grid. you need to guess the word that can be formed by those scattered letters. but this game is not just guessing the word. you also need to connect all the letter in a single path, line, connection or flow which start from the first letter, go through all the letter and then end at the last letter of the word. and the challenge doe not end here. you also need to cover all the square on the grid. no square can be left empty. in this way, when you connect letter by letter in a sequential order, you are more likely to remember the spelling of the word. the following link is a gameplay video. what do you guy think?
