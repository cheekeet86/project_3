20,t3_cctzvk,3d printing full games? opinions?,10,i love game and some are just downright expensive. i have taken it upon myself after spending time in this subreddit to print a full hive game set. is this frowned on or what are people stance on it? we already own catan and i wa planning on printing a 3d board set for it because i think it is cooler and i can paint them to bring them to life even more. thoughts? opinions? edit: y’all have been wonderful it’s nice seeing defense against it. i don’t know what i will do. i want to play container. i have no problem supporting and buying a game but for an oop $300 copy my wife might slap me sideways. hive i’ll just go buy. fuck it. $25. and i am still planning a wood laser cut copy of catan. i already own it with some expansions. but when i teach new people they can’t tell the difference between meadow and forest. i also have young kid and my board ha been messed up a time or two from them. so an interlocking puzzle set is better option to me.
21,t3_ccyqod,"finished first game of terraforming mars, have a couple of newbie questions!",1,"hey guys, i'm basically the host whenever we have a board game session, so i read through the rule and played finish our first game. it wa super intense, and we all came in like 58, 58 and 57. anyway, i've got a couple of questions: 1) in the context of a new game / fresh board, it seems that ocean are a bad idea in term of 'competitiveness'. it doe not reward/incentivize anything. what i mean is: you spend resource placing an ocean down, and you don't even get the bonus. anyone else can get the bonus. so you, a the person placing it, spend resource to put in a tile in which you only benefit from +1 to tr and placement bonuses, whereas someone else could just wait it out, place a greenery tile, own the area (which count towards the landlord award and gardener milestone), get +1 to tr a well, and also +1 vp from the greenery itself. (not to mention +1 if he owns a city beside it). thus i am having a hard time comprehending why would anybody want to ever place an ocean first. the opportunity cost is so much greater than if you were to just spend the same amount of resource building a greenery. 2) some card say ""require 7% oxygen"", i'm assuming this is require 7% oxygen or greater, correct? because it wouldn't be logical if it wa literally playable on exactly 7% oxygen levels. (asking this because some of the card are worded with ""x% or less"" or ""x% or more"" whereas some card dont have these texts) 3) some card say, for example, add 2 microbe / animal to another card. doe this mean that you must have another card that ""collects"" these resources? e.g. decomposers card collect microbes, so you can only add the microbe to this card, correct? i'm guessing if you don't have decomposers, or any other micro-resource collection card, then basically you can't add these micro-resources. 4) because there are so many thing to track / move everytime you do something, e.g. paying 8 plant to add a greenery tile, you have to physically move the cube back to the cube pile, then add your tile, put the player marker, add the tr, raise the oxygen, and even many other power card that may or may not activate. thus, if a player forgets the passive of these cards, what's the best play here? allow the player to retroactively get the resource or just too bad for him cuz he wasted his resources? 5) in term of the ""sabotage"" cards, e.g. meteor or asteroid which will remove plant resource from a player, what is the incentive of not doing so? it seems logical to always do it (it is a competitive game after all) but the rule mention something about it being 'optional' and that 'it is not very nice' to do so. thanks so much for all time and input. looking forward to more game of this, and probably will buy the expansion in the future."

42,t3_ccteu2,bestie and i had an epic 80-hour gaming heptathalon on a 10-day gaming retreat!,62,"so i have a vacation home in the pacific northwest. i invited several friend to go relax, retreat, and game, but most of the time it wa my best buddy and me. we created a gaming olympiad, a heptathalon (if that's a word), and i'm going to tell you all about it! if you wanna read only about certain events, you can skip forward to: 1: pixel tactic 2: mtg power cube 3: deck builder 4: epic 5: battlecon 6: carl chudyk 7: food chain magnate the olympiad consisted of 7 events, or pillars. first to win 4 take it down. we jumped around from pillar to pillar each day to prevent burn out on one game. pillar 1: pixel tactic constructed. create 3 deck from all the sets. play each deck versus each opposing deck twice each (18 games) plus one game with the deck of your choice. best 10/19 game take the pillar. this pillar took an incredible amount of prep. we had to sort through about 15 card and pick 3 leader to build around. that took day of analysis paralysis. ultimately, the leader i picked hard countered a couple of his. like, he had byron (all your dude have two life but only ever take one damage) and i had lixis (1 damage to all opposing dude every wave). he had adjenna (opponents can't use clear corpse action) and i had luca (you can redraw top card of discard pile if you use it right away, ie spam revive corpse orders). after about 8 match and having seen each of our leaders, he scooped the pillar to me to save time. and no, there wa no coming back, his scoop wa not premature. pillar 2: mtg power cubes. i have two vintage powered cubes. one that is more combo oriented and balanced, and one that ha almost no combo and is more interactive. so we started with the combo cube. we pack drafted two deck simultaneously, having to allocate each drafted card to deck a or b. then each deck played each opposing deck in a best 3/5 match. that's 4 match so far. then we used the other cube and simultaneously drafted 3 deck and played each against each other in a 3/5 (9 more matches). best 7/13 match take the pillar. so in the first cube, i dominated. drafted a show n tell style deck and a mono green crater hoof natural order deck. he drafted a reanimator deck and a mono white control/armageddon/winter orb/stax deck. both mine beat both of his and i took a 4-0 match advantage. then on the other cube, i drafted mono red aggro, mono white midrange, and ub control. he drafted esper control, jund midrange, and wg aggro. he stormed back! my red deck lost two match them barely beat wg on a mana screw. then my w deck went 0-3. so now the match score is 5-5!!! first to 7 take the pillar. then my ub beat jund, barely, with game 5 ending in such a grind that he deck out. 6-5. then my ub beat wg and take down the pillar! extremely nerve wracking. i thought he wa gonna crack my 4-0 lead!!! pillar 3: deck building. so we were really limited on game due to suitcase space. so in this pillar, we would play star realms, tanto cuore, and flip city, each best 3/5. whoever win two of those three take the pillar. we start with star realms. i win two in a row then he win 3. then we play flip city and he sweep me. take down the pillar in under 2 hours!! pillar 4: epic. so for those not familiar, this game is kinda mtg: lite. so we each have 3 set of cards. we started by open drafting a deck and playing 3/5, which i took down. then we constructed 2 deck each and played 4 match best 3/5 each. we split those. i took down the pillar best 3 of 5 match (each 3/5 games). interestingly, one pair of deck we each built wa quite similar, a red yellow control deck with lot of removal and recursion. pillar 5: battlecon. so we each drafted 20 fighter and split them into 5 team of 4. we use each team once, best 3/5 match (one team versus another team for a match). the format wa this: simultaneously ban an opposing fighter. then play best of 3. game 1 you simultaneously pick an opposing fighter they can't use in game 1. game two feature an arena effect. best 2/3 take the match. match 1: the game 2 arena say that each beat, you gain a life if you didn't hit the opposing fighter. i ban madelina (scary) and he ban seth. game 1: my prince elien loses to clinhyde a i'm unable to ever benefit from my wall protection. game 2 is my tatsumi versus his runika. we dance around forever. i'm trying to gradually pick off his artifact before engaging. late, i end up making a blunder on a beat where he couldn't even reach me by waking forward directly into his fist and giving the game away. he's up 1 match to none. match 2. the game 2 arena gradually fill the board up with candle on your space, end of beat, or damage you if you're on one. when board is full of candles, you can then ante candle you're on to gain various effects, including ignore stun guard. he ban aria, i ban shekhtur. game 1: my burgundy loses to his lymn. lymn constantly cause prio mix ups and i wa repeatedly wrong. game 2 my karin play way too predictably and loses to his main, zaamassal. he take match 2 and now i'm totally in my own head, feeling like he can read me at every decision. match 3: the game 2 arena say you can fall off the edge of the board and take 4 damage. i ban wardlaw, his 3-4th main. he ban khadath. by the way, each of these battlecon match wa a different day, allowing the loser top rest and recoup. i reached the conclusion that i had been playing on yomi level zero (ie just playing what i thought were good attack pairs) and he wa anticipating those. i went back to my old method of analyzing what his most likely pair were. game 1 my lucida crush his merjoram. both character want to stand still and trade. mine just doe it better. he also didn't have his full concentration that day, hard reading me on several beat and just being bad at math and punting. game 2 my jin beat his sarafina. sara is one of my mains, which he hate drafted not really knowing how to use her. i hard read him a couple times, and my movement and hit confirm nullified his mix ups. i win the set 2-0 and trail 1 match to 2. match 4: the game 2 arena say each beat ha a 50% chance of recycling backwards. i ban hepzibah (our consensus #1 pick agreed) he ban kajia. game 1 my rukyuk beat his iaxus. neither of u play these character much, but i get there. game 2 i got what i thought wa a good match up, my malandrax versus his kehrolyn, but i actually had trouble keeping her off me and he got there. 1-1. game 3 my clive versus his cadenza. he remark that this is a great matchup for him since he can stun me off my modules. i stay silent. basically i take one big hit and then keep him at bay the rest of the game. he even land a grapnel but i foresee this and use the thing that negates his on hit effects, so he can't pull me. i take it down easily. 2-2 in matches. fortunately i have my strongest team last. match 5: game 2 arena say the lower health player can move a barrier marker and nobody can end their movement on it. i ban adjenna, his second main, he ban thessala, my #1 pick. game 1 my cherri squeak out a win against cesar. game 2 in the arena is my lesandra versus his lixis. i request we play game 3 first since i have a great matchup, which we do. my baenvier crush his orianna. i wait till he commits a lot of magic point to an attack them simply negate our styles, rendering his character practically useless. i win the final match and thus the pillar (making a huge comeback) and thus the entire olympiad. pillar 6: chudyk. best 4/7 mottainai, best 2/3 impulse, best 2/3 gtr. whoever win two of those take it. he win mottainai 4-3 but we don't end up completing the pillar because i won battlecon that afternoon and ended it. pillar 7: beat 2/3 food chain magnate. didn't start this one. well hope you enjoyed reading this. we had a great time playing the most epic gaming marathon ever. took 80 hour to finish."

52,t3_cd9zij,"city of king is very fun, until it suddenly isn't.",90,"my wife and i picked up the game from a local store. it wa beautiful, we love co-op, we love videogames, we love rpg mechanics, what wa there not to be stoked about?! we watched the tutorial video, set up the most basic scenario, started leveling up. it wa super fun! ... until it wasn't anymore. suddenly we found a monster that did 3 reflect damage a our second fight, thank the game god we could camp him to death from inside the city. but after that thing became more manageable, it wa lovely exploring and getting gear, we had a lot of fun! ... until we weren't. because the objective wa to get a ton of ore, and we would have needed to go buckwild leveling up our caravan to even get close to winning. we were doomed from turn 4 or so. so we set up a story. tried to plan out a bit better. i went hard healer, she went damage and worker wild. it wa a ton of fun, tromping over the map, working together to finish quests! ... until it wasn't. a monster popped up with 3 range and way more than enough damage to wipe u both out in a single attack. i'd been upping my hp and healing alternately, and i still wa 1-shot-kill-able. i literally would have had to put every point into health from square one to tank even a single attack, and then i'd have been useless for everything else but that. and that's not including abilities. we waited for game night. 4 people surely would be more balanced, right? my wife went full tank, i went full healer, one of our friend went damage and the other wa god of workers. ... following the rule of setup, the first monster did 5 reflect damage, and did more than enough damage per attack to kill 1 if not 2 people. so that wa a hard reset. we cheated. took the point for leveling up to the starting xp level a well a the starting boosts. started the enemy at level 1 instead of 5. and you know what? the game wa really, super fun! we played around, joked, everyone got to do what they loved doing most, it wa a fantastic time! ... until it wasn't. the bos spawned. we had been leveling up a lot, had really solid gear. we were pretty speciallized, so we didn't run into the same problem a before where nobody had enough damage to justify hitting a reflect, or enough up to take even a single hit. but the bos spawned with an ability called 'whirlwind' (random chance to get that...) which deal half his attack to all nearby ally of the main target. now, the tank had 20 hp, and the bos had 16 frelling attack. so the tank barely survived. whirlwind, however, team wiped the rest of us, none of u having specced into health enough to suddenly eat 8 damage, not when you factored in all the poison and fire he wa making appear everywhere a well, when the game had taught u the gospel of ""specialize, specialize, specialize!"" so we immedeately, without any chance to react or have any warning, the first turn the bos appeared, in spite of the fact we cheated to be massively overleveled for where the game said we should be, lost in a single attack when he killed all 3 of us. that wasn't fun. and it didn't feel like we'd planned poorly, or like we had been out strategied or like there wa a single damn thing we could do about it. we died, it felt like, because ""f*ck you"", and there wa no reason any other outcome should have been expected. in my experiance, city of king is beautiful, clever, wild, fantastic, and a pure joy to play, especilly with friend when you each get to play the way you all want to play. the problem is when the game abruptly, and without warning, decides that the fun is over, and if you aren't positioned like x or specd out like y or have at least a in b stat, you lose now. thanks for playing, jerkwad. our worker player felt awful because once the bos spawned, she couldn't do much, and ended up being one of the one who died. the game directly punished her for doing what it claimed she should have been more than free to do, to play her hero the way she deemed most enjoyable. i don't know when we'll be playing again. if we even will. but i know i'll want to. i'll remember the good times. roaming the board with friends, leveling up, beating monster and completing quests. but i'll always remember ""this guy doe 16 damage to the tank, and 8 damage to everyone else. then he spawn fire and poison everywhere."" ""so... we lose then?"" ""...yea. i guess. huh. that sucks."" the game is incredibly fun. until it isn't. and i hate that i have to say that. edit: it ha come to my attention that the bos wa played incorrectly. no matter what, say a small paragraph hidden on page 26 of the rulebook, upon spawning a bos doe not immedeately activate. it is an easy mistake to make, a the turn order guide on your sheet, which the rule point out earlier ""if you have any question about when what happens, the guide will set you straight."" seem to imply the bos activates first, unless you know of this exception beforehand. please note that, even with this new info, my opinion stands. the bos spawned, and evwn if we scattered and planned, he did 16 damage per swing, not taking into account completely filling the map with fire and poison, and teleporting directly to people. and my complaint is so much deeper than ""boss beat me, game bad."" it wasn't just the boss. even the two player game my wife and i won felt more like we succeeded by playing the game the least fun possible way. because that wa what the game demanded, what it wanted. it is a bunch of really fun and exciting concepts, wrapped in a thorny box of ""use none of this. max damage and hp."""

80,t3_cdk284,game with distinct act,50,"hi all, i just played the new jaw board game over the weekend, and afterwards our group talked about game with distinct acts. jaw is a one v all game with two acts. the first act involves hidden movement/deduction around an island map and the second is an extended battle sequence on a sinking boat. the act share some physical components, but also have game piece specific to each act. when the first act concludes, all the board flip over, component are exchanged, and new game mechanic kick in. the only game i have personally played with two separate half are biblios, betrayal at house on the hill, and galaxy trucker: - in biblios, the two half (gift phase and auction phase) use the same deck of cards, but their mechanic for adding card to your hand are drastically different. act one us card allocation (drafting) and act two obviously us an auction. - in betrayal, the beginning of the haunt trigger a shift from coop to one v all gameplay (usually), a well a a whole additional set of rule and components. - galaxy trucker begin with a real-time tile placement phase and end with an event resolution/scoring phase. what are some other example of this type of game structure? i am not so much talking about game with multi-step phase (i.e., dinosaur island). i also wouldn’t necessarily include the final battle against the baddie in elder sign or camp grizzly, a these moment are relatively short compared the bulk of the game. multiple act are an interesting way of forcing a narrative shift in gameplay, a opposed to shift that occur naturally (e.g., switching gear in dominion to begin grabbing victory cards). i am also interested in how multi-act game might relate/intertwine act one with act two. in both jaw and biblios, your performance in act one ha direct implication for act two. jaw allows you to play either act standalone, whereas my other example must be played with both. anyway, let me know your thoughts! i think this would be a cool top ten list."

119,t3_cdwbai,question about too many bone,7,"i have an unusual question regarding too many bone which usually doesn't come up in online reviews. 95% of all my boardgaming happens with my gf in 2p. english is not our first language, and the problem is my knowledge of the language it is much better than my girlfriend's. when i look for new boardgames i always have to factor in the discrepancy i our knowledge of english to know whether a game will work for us. the game we play are usually not very intensely text based. me translating every significant card or effect to her really feel awful for both of us. my question is how much english text there is in too many bone and how much of a factor doe knowing specific textual queue pose in playing the game successfully. one example of a game where english became an issue wa munchkins. you're supposed to keep your card secret, and also understand what the card mean in order to cross reference the different effect across card in order to set up meaningful plays. her asking me the translation of card i'm not dupposed to see really defeated the fun in the game."

157,t3_ceftjg,battle of westeros: fantasy flight's other game of throne board game,12,"way back in 2003, fantasy flight game released the *a game of thrones* board game, which essentially fused element of the classic board game *diplomacy* into the **a song of ice and fire** setting. a huge success, the game ha remained continuously in print up until today, getting a second edition and multiple expansions, the latest of which wa released only last year, along the way. back in 2010 fantasy flight released their second asoiaf-based board game, *battles of westeros*, a miniature wargame which, a the box proclaims, spin off of the popular *battlelore* rule system. the game received several expansions, but the line wa abruptly cancelled in 2012. despite that, the base game remains available at reasonable price thanks to ebay, although the expansion are a lot more hit and miss. having recently gotten a copy of the game and several expansion (*lords of the river*, *tribes of the vale* and the big *house baratheon* expansion), i wa surprised to see that the game had done poorly, a it is excellent. on a basic level, *battles of westeros* is a spin-off of the popular **command colors** line of wargame/board game hybrid created by designer richard borg in 2000. this system ha spawned a whole range of different iterations, the best-known and biggest-selling of which is the wwii version, *memoir ’44*. the most recent is the excellent space opera version, *red alert: space fleet warfare*, with other version ranging from *command colors: napoleonics* to *tricorne* (based on the american revolutionary war) to *the great war*, based on wwi. most relevant here is *battlelore*, a fantasy version featuring knights, griffins, troll and elves. *battles of westeros* proudly proclaims itself “a *battlelore* game,” which is being somewhat elastic with the truth a the game pretty much rewrite the rule of both *battlelore* and **command colors** so much that only the basic element remain in common. for gameplay purposes, you play scenario which pit two army against one another. the base game allows you to play stark vs. lannister, but the expansion add the baratheon and tully forces, a well a the irregular force of the brotherhood without banner and the tribe of the vale of arryn. the scenario detail tell you how to set up the map, which is a plain green field covered in hexes. you place hexagonal token on the map to depict scenery, such a hills, villages, mountains, river and forest (the *house baratheon* expansion also feature a second map, depicting the blackwater rush and the wall of king’s landing), and set up your army a directed. each army consists of archers, infantry, cavalry and – most critically – “leaders.” these leader are special unit depicting the commander of the army in question, such a robb stark, jaime lannister, brienne of tarth, shagga, stannis baratheon, brynden the blackfish and so on. these unit are usually quite powerful in combat, but they also play an important role in giving order to your troop (and getting them captured or killed can be a devastating blow). the game’s biggest deviation away from the **command colors** system is that the board is not divided into sectors. those game have a central sector and two flanks, and you draw card telling you how many unit in each sector you can use on that turn. *battles of westeros* replaces this with you playing card a order given by your leader to troop within yelling distance. so, you play a card on a leader and he or she can direct unit within 2 hex of their figure. this is immediately more logical and also cause each player to carefully consider each turn how to manoeuvre their army (and keep their leader within order-giving range of their key troop without endangering them). each turn you also get a number of general-purpose order token you can use to order any unit on the map, regardless of if they are in range of a leader or not, which is handy if you have a bunch of archer on a hill off to one side of the battlefield you want to take potshot at enemy force without getting a general to ride over and keep telling them to do so. each leader also ha special abilities, some they can use continuously and extremely powerful once-per-game ability (such a allowing your troop to attack twice in one turn) that can prove decisive if used wisely. there are additional rule for flanking enemy troop and veterancy: not all your troop are equal, with their experience denoted by the colour of their flag (green for fresh recruits, blue for experienced soldier and red for veterans). that also determines how many dice they roll in attack and how far they move, with more experienced troop generally being slower but able to hit much harder. there is also a morale tracker, which swing back and forth determining on how the battle is going: lose too many unit to the enemy without inflicting comparable damage and your army can rout altogether. despite this level of detail, *battles of westeros* is not a particularly complex game, especially if you have some previous experience of the **command colors** system. most turn have you playing a card on a leader, moving the figure of the troop they are commanding and rolling dice to determine if they are successful, and that’s pretty much it, unless you want to use a special ability. you then draw some new cards, roll some dice to determine how many other unit you can move and away you go. each scenario ha specific victory condition or complication to add variety to the game, and each leader ha their own set of card which you can add to your command deck, which add quite a bit of longevity and replay value to the game, which is increased even further by the expansions. the game’s presentation is solid (fantasy flight ha built up a beautiful library of **asoiaf**\-related artwork over the last fifteen years), the rule are reasonably comprehensible and well-laid out, and the production value of the component is excellent. most copy of the game you’ll find now are getting on for a decade, and every one i’ve seen ha been in good nick. the card are also good quality and the miniature are impressive, although a little on the small side. the rule are great, and if you’ve played a lot of **command colors** the change will likely be welcome. in particular, tying the order card to the leader figure rather than random sector simply make a hell of a lot more sense, and it’d be cool to see this idea moved over to some of the other game in the same line. complete newcomer may find a slightly steeper hill to climb, but in overall term and compared to many contemporary board game (especially those on the wargame side of things), the game is not particularly hard to learn. the negative are relatively minor, but there are a few niggles. the figure don’t fit into their base very well, so it’s recommended you glue them in, which can be fiddly and time-consuming. the only reason they’re not pre-fitted to the base is to make painting them easier, but the figure are small enough that i don’t really see the value of painting them. a a fantasy flight game there are also an absolute ton of fiddly tokens, symbol and paraphernalia, a lot of which are really unnecessary to the game. another negative with the rule is that the game is extremely limited in counterattacking options, to the point where it very rarely happens. it feel like the idea of using order token to allow counterattacking (recently employed in *red alert*) should be implemented here. another issue is the length of gameplay. **command colors** is best-known for being relatively fast to play, especially versus traditional wargames, with it being possible to blast through say a few *memoir ’44* scenario in 30-45 minute apiece. *battles of westeros* ha no truck with this, and you’ll be lucky to get a scenario done in much under two hours. however, the much greater detail of the combat mean you’ll be making much more interesting decision than in a standard cc games, so the greater length can be seen a a reflection of the greater depth of gameplay. if you want a fast-playing wargame, break out *memoir ’44*, if you want something a bit more detailed if slower then unleash *battlelore* or *red alert*, but if you want something longer, meatier and more engrossing, *battles of westeros* work fine for that. the biggest weakness is, of course, the lack of ongoing support. despite the success of the tv show, fantasy flight have shown little interest in resurrecting the game and the recent release of cmon games’ *a song of ice and fire: the tabletop miniature game* (which ha far more beautiful miniature and considerably less-compelling rules) suggests they may no longer have the miniature right to do so. there are some online resource to extend the game and there are enough scenario in the base game and expansion to ensure you will get a lot of value out of the game. *battles of westeros* (\*\*\*\*½) is a fine addition to any library of **asoiaf**\-based games, or a solid 2-player wargame, if you can track down a copy at a good price."
158,t3_ceqkie,unpopular opinion: root actually isn't that good. discuss!,0,"hi all. so i bought into the root hype and got super excited about it. eventually i got the chance to play. i've played 2-player twice and 3-player once and my experience have all been... meh. i feel like the unique(-ish) premise of having up to 4 faction playing by totally different rulesets sound amazing in principle but underdelivers in practice. it's just not that exciting, and the game is not a deep a you'd imagine given the asymmetry. the factions, while very different from each other, are each kind of simplistic once you break it down. so ultimately you are left with a game that is le robust than conventional symmetric games, since it isn't more than the sum of it parts, or even just the sum of it parts: it feel like le than the sum of it part because while there are many rule due to the separate faction rulesets, they don't add up to one rich system of rule but many light system of rule that operate independently and don't apply to any one player all at once. the result is a game that never really get that involving, because strategy is relatively limited and there is not a great deal to think about. of course, this is all how it appears to me, and i am aware that others will have differing opinion and disagree, which is fine. i guess i just think the game is overrated over-celebrated. it's rare to read much criticism of it and i'm not sure why. my main positive take away is that it show how asymmetry can work. otherwise, it just doesn't seem that interesting to me. feel free to agree or disagree! i'm interested to hear other opinions!"

(i'm not into the competitive scene by the way.) and that is because they are not simple game to tackle with. besides them requiring quite a lot of money spent on them, which you either have or don't, there are other thing which separate them from normal board games. they require some time to understand the rule and deal with the usually long and ever expanding faq. then play some game and read the rule and faq again. then try to come up with strategy and building list and decks, which for some, me included, is half the fun. and on top of that, having someone else a involved a you are in all of that, because all of these are kind of lifestyle game more or le and you want someone who will have spent the same amount of time and money to face a an opponent. and probably a lot more that i can't think of right now. so, back at me, staring at my collection i'm wondering if all of these game will ever see the light of day in the way they deserve or if i should just let go of some of them. what's your view on the subject? did you ever have that dilemma in your gaming life? how many of these lifestyle game have you managed to cramp in your normal everyday lives, between family, work and everything else? can you enjoy them even if you play them casually every now and then? is it even possible to do so?"

236,t3_cetq3y,the top 100 that no one asked for: 90-81,30,"i really got into the hobby around march 2017 when i received small world, lord of waterdeep, and betrayal at house on the hill for my birthday. i had played game before, but didn’t start buying and really playing until around this time. in june 2017, i downloaded bg stats and started recording my plays. on july 16, 2019, i hit 100 unique game played. this is my ranking of those games. i’m putting the number of play for each game so that you may see at what point my judgment is coming from. sometimes a game need multiple plays, sometimes one is enough. 100-91: ?utm_source=shareutm_medium=ios_app 90\. **qwirkle** - 1 play (recorded, but many more than that) – i am bad at this game. my wife always crushes. it’s just shape and colors? no. it’s crap and garbage. now, this game isn’t low because i’m bad. i swear. i’m not that bitter. this game just doesn’t do anything for me. is anyone ever excited to play qwirkle? this game is now block for my daughter to build tower with. congrats qwirkle, you’ve staved off elimination with toddler immunity. 89\. **meeple circus** - 1 play – i played this at origin this year. i had this game built up so much in my group a this game we had to get. i just never wanted to spend $50 on it. i would try and make bet where the loser had to buy meeple circus. i just had to stack an elephant meeple on a tiger on a strong man. but man, it wa underwhelming. i think if i wa given this game, i’d play it for stupid fun about once every 6 months, but this is definitely not worth spending money on. 88\. **blokus** - 1 play (recorded, but many more than that) – i’ve said “don’t talk shit about blokus” more than once to my friends. this game is fine, i’m actually probably more willing to play it than other game above it. it’s just not exciting. blokus is green beans. there’s nothing offensive about it, but i’m never going choose put it on my plate. please don’t @ me about green beans. 87\. **dominion: intrigue** - 1 play – this went over so well i don’t even remember playing it. i’ve played regular dominion too (that’s obviously higher up). i must’ve just had a bad experience with these set of cards. i dunno. just play base dominion 86\. **covert** - 2 play – both these play were at 2 players. i wonder if this would be better at more players. my friend bought this game, we learned it on the spot and he’s never brought it up again. he’s left all of his game at my house…except this one. sometimes i wonder if this game is covert is actually a spy and it’s ran off to do it next spy thing, but more than likely it’s in the trash can. 85\. **smash up** - 1 play – i played this game on the tail end of a decathalon (10 game in a day) and it wa the only game that divulged into a quasi-argument. possibly because it had been 14 hour with the same people, but that just left a bad taste in my mouth. i don’t get offended by being attacked in other game or take that, but something happened that game. i could see this game being fun. if i owned it, i bet it would rise up. 84\. **five tribes** - 8 play – i put this game in my 10x10 this year and due to this, five tribe ha fallen about 50 spots. player with ap kill this game…absolutely kill it. this game should’ve come with a sand timer. if you don’t make a move in 30 seconds, you lose a billion coins. you may remember from the last 10 that variability doe not equal replayability. this is the poster child. set up is always different, different djinns, market row…ton of variability. the optimal strategy stay the same though. don’t bid high, something will be there for you. go for green and set collect a much a possible. a soon a i’m finished with my 10x10, this game is going gone. 83\. **risk** - 1 play (recorded, but many more than that) – this is what i did in high school. my friend would come over every saturday and we played risk. i loved risk so much. it felt like war. i don’t get the whole “i don’t like game x because it didn’t make me feel like a coal miner.” it’s a board game! you’re pushing around cardboard and plastic! but risk did make me feel like a war strategist. it just doesn’t hold up now that i’ve played other games. it’s too long. it’s too luck dependent. it’s too king-making. and if anyone is going to be king-making, it’s going to be me (my last name is king and i’ve made 2 kings). 82\. **risk legacy** - 8 play – it end faster? this is hurt because i played pandemic legacy before this game, but man, there’s not much to it. i expected story. i expected wholesale change every game. this just doesn’t deliver. only 7 more play to go…oh my gosh…7 more plays. 81\. **12 days** - 12 play (that’s weird) – on the 5th day of christmas my true love gave to me…would you look at that? it’s…it’s another 11. who would have thought? this is the 5th 11 i’ve been passed. i love christmas. i’m like a 10 year old at christmas. i like getting gifts, i like giving gifts, i like the songs, and i like the movies. and i do like playing 12 day around the holidays. but the game ain’t great, folks. but it 15 minute and it’s got a fun theme and it’s a little different than other stuff i’ve played. five tribes, you were beaten out by a card game that can be played 3 week out of the year."

246,t3_ceryr0,"arkham horror lcg in comparison to eldritch/arkham/mansions, your thoughts?",23,"hi all, #x200b; i really enjoy playing game in the lovecraft universe and i also like to play 2 player game every now and then so i really had to buy the arkham horror lcg when i got the chance. i already own eldritch horror and often play mansion of madness 2nd edition so i wa interested where this would fit in to the collection. however, after playing the first campaign through maybe 4 time i really cannot see where all the hype is coming from so i want to hear from others what it is that they like about the game. i will list some of the reason why i like the other two much better. #x200b; **set up:** the lcg ha a very large setup and pack away time in my opinion, and it at least feel that it take a long a eldritch to set up and certainly longer than mansions. **story:** i wa fairly underwhelmed with the story side of the lcg. much of the flavour text is repeated in one paragraph or two in 2 or 3 different locations. there is some branching of path but it feel very minimal to me. in contrast, i think that the storytelling in mansion is far superior and that the story really drive the game forward. some of the newer scenario in particular are amazing. **character development:** in the lcg character development is mostly done by modifying your deck. to me this feel underwhelming because one might add 2 or 3 card over the course of a campaign and you may never in see them in your playthrough, a the deck are quite large. in contrast i find the character development in eldritch very exciting because you find a lot of item that drastically change play, new spells, and improving skill ha a huge impact. **cost:** this is a big one, probably the biggest. a 4 player version of the lcg cost something like 70 euro (having to buy 2 copy of the game). this is more expensive than either eldritch or mansion and ha so many fewer piece and scenarios. this includes one campaign with three missions. the value from eldritch or mansion seems far superior to me. **replayability:** i think that the lcg doe have a good amount of replayability. you can play with different combination of the 4 character and try to figure out way to win with those combinations. however, there is only one story in the box and the branching path are very minimal. mansion ha i think 5 scenario out of the box and new one are much cheaper than the lcg expansions. eldritch is not so story based so the comparison is not entirely fair but it doe come with 4 elder god and i think 12 character so the replayability is much higher in my opinion. #x200b; so, in conclusion i find that the lcg sits somewhere between eldritch and mansions. however, if you like the storytelling side then you are better off with mansions, if you prefer the character development side then go with eldritch. not to mention that both of these are, in my opinion, much better value for money than the lcg. i am very interested to hear from others who have played other game in the universe and why they think that the lcg is the superior game. #x200b; please, let u know if you have played arkham horror, eldritch horror or mansion of madness before in your post."

(with each player taking one action per turn, there is very little down time in between turns.) -mostly well balanced. (although not all bird are created equal, more on this in the cons, i felt they did a good job with most of the bird power to keep most game from having a runaway winner.) -artwork and overall aesthetics. (the eggs, dice, bird house, and everything else look amazing!) -theming. (again, between the amazing artwork and the high quality component this game ha excellent theming! they even take it a step further with fact being at the bottom of every bird card in the game a well a where they are found around the world.) - card galore! (with 170 unique bird card it give the game massive replay value.) cons: -egg spamming is no joke! (i found the entire final round we would all simply lay egg making it kind of an uneventful end to the game.) -not all ability are created equal. (i’m looking at you tuck a card, draw a card. get a few of these and a repeat a brown power bird and victory is yours.) -box organization isn’t the best. (im not a huge fan of loose components, but this is really more of a nitpick). -only two of the habitat are any good. (you really only need one bird in the water habitat if that. drawing bird card are necessary, but laying eggs, gaining food, and playing bird are where the real point are.) 8/10 - great! the game isn’t perfect, but i always have a blast playing it. this one will be hitting our table hard and frequently!"

(3 girl and 2 guys) two of the girl are now complaining about ""game nights."" beforehand we will decide what we are playing and normally play 1 round (sometimes 2,) a most of these game take some time. they say that we don't have game night a we only play one game per night. they want to play party game like card against humanity, secret hitler, what do you meme and uno or other card games. even though these game are quicker to play, they are more fun in bigger groups. all the game exept got is mine and the night are always at my house. have you ever experienced something similar? how can i change their view (if even possible) to just see that if they are invited to play boardgames during the week, it is specifically for u in a smaller group and the party game is for the extended group of friend over weekend at braais/bbq's/get togethers?"

294,t3_c69q3z,not alone: hard mode for alien?,2,"so yesterday my friend and i broke out not alone for the first time. it wa a fun time, but we noticed a bit of a imbalance. noting that it wa our first playthrough we realize that there were thing that the alien could and need to do on the first turn. such a locking down the rover asap, but hindsight is always 20/20. but here come the title of the post, we noticed that since we played with fewer players, 3 hunted v the alien. that the chance of the hunted escape each round get radically higher. since the alien start with two token only, if the hunted played well to diversify their selection and saved their survival card the alien can be evaded consistently. have you guy encountered this scenario with the alien having a tougher time v a smaller team of hunted? what house rule would you suggest to even out the imbalance. the hunted survived with the alien only assimilating twice. it also felt like the phase on the hunt card for the alien could be redone since some of them would be better in other phases. again this is pondering is only off of one first time play through, but our group is a small group so any input on this would be welcome."
295,t3_c6ijhm,kingdomino (x2) or king + queendomino for 4+ player,11,"hey, i am just starting to build a small collection of board game and looking for some great games. **introduction:** i am looking for game that you can learn quick and play right away even with new players. but at the same time having played many pc game with a lot of complexity (strategy like civilizations, arpgs like diablo ii and path of exile and game like factorio). so i also love complex game mechanics. i started about 2-3 week ago looking for something one could play when we have guests. first thing i bought is machi koro which check al the mark we were looking for. easy to teach, quick to start and beginner don't get destroyed by experienced players. only negative thing is that sometimes you get so many building that you need a lot of space on the table. #x200b; then just recently i bought carcassonne which i think can be perfect because it's still easy to teach and you can start quick enough while it ha more complexity which i like. gonna test it on the weekend. for the future i also put terra mystica and spirit island on my list fore more complex game that can be played when we have more time and look for something more challenging. **kingdomino:** now that you know a little about our background, i found out about kingdomino just recently and thought about adding it to the collection of game that can be quickly explained and started with guests. but we want to be able to also play game when we are more then 4. so we were wondering if we should get 2x kingdomino or 1x kingdomino and 1x queendomino. i read that many don't like queendomino because it take away the simplicity of kingdomino. but i myself like it a little more complex and wa wondering if it would be so much more difficult to teach it to new players. #x200b; if we go for 2x kingdomino i'm afraight that it could get boring too quick. but when we get 1 king and 1 queen i wa wondering if it would become to complicated to quickly start with new players. though i guess that if we'd start with king + queen with more then 4 players, we could play 1 round without the queen rule to introduce them to the base mechanic and then add the queen rules. the first round the red tile would be completely useless but i think for the purpose of teaching that would be fine. so what are your thought someone who is just starting with boardgames should get? 2x king or 1 king and 1 queen?"

304,t3_c624gn,"gateway games, gatekeeping, and complexity snobbery",704,"**tl;dr bit of a rant about snobbery in boardgaming, and looking down on people who enjoy or even deliberately prefer ""gateway"" or ""party"" game for whatever reason.** this is something that i see in many place and in many text on the subject, and it's been bugging me for a while, so apology if it's already been covered to death elsewhere (but please provide me a link a i'd love to follow any other discussion on the subject). now, i'm not a new gamer by any means, but neither am i a super dedicated one. life ha moved on and these day i'm in my late 30s, i have a family with young kids, and pets, and a demanding job, and plenty of other hobby that don't involve gaming in any manner whatsoever. this mean that the dd all-nighters of my youth are gone, and i simply don't have the time or budget to invest in lengthy, complex game that take hour for a single session. this mean that thing in category like ""party games"" and ""gateway games"" are perfect for me. they don't cost the earth or eat up all of my free time. i can teach them to newer gamers quite easily, in some case play with my older kids, and for my more experienced gamer friend they represent a way to fit several game into an otherwise relatively short game night. a an example of what prompted me to write this post, sometimes i come across comment like [this one]() in a recent discussion: i overheard another customer be mocked by their friend and an employee for buying a party game. he wa met with comment like ""oh, he's new to gaming"" and ""he'll get there."" okay, that's a horrible unflgs, because you don't have to be new or inexperienced to enjoy a party game, and i think we can all agree on the wrongness of this behaviour. but the op there also continued to say: please stop doing this to our new folk. everyone is new to gaming at some point. it can be fun to explore new and increasingly more complex games. it can also be fun to whip out exploding kitten and coup. a lot of these serve a gateway game that get people more involved. the message is well-meant. but while he wa attacking the awful behaviour of the people at the game store, he wa also reinforcing the existing bias that *party game and gateway game are only for people who are new and learning about gaming*, and even the term ""gateway game"" itself suggests that it's an intermediate step, before you get into ""real"" games. i understand the history of the term and it is generally the case that these are lower-complexity game that really do serve this purpose, but what bug me is the implication that you *ought to* move on from such game and onto ""proper"" games, only bringing them out again for newbie or at parties. i'm sure many ""real"" gamers would frown at my collection of mostly gateway and party games, and tell me haughtily that i'm not a real gamer because i don't have anything that can't be played in under three hours. but you know what? i like these games. i don't play them to prove some point to myself, or my friends, or to show how advanced i am a a gamer. i play the game that i play because they are fun, and they are social, and they don't eat into time i don't have. and i don't see them a in any way inferior. sure, i'm no stranger to thing like *twilight struggle* and i'd play longer and more complex game if i had the time - but even if i did, i don't always want that. so can we all get off our collective high horse about gateway game and party game and just accept that they are a good a any other game? #x200b; *^(edit 1: minor change to clarify why i'm quoting what i'm quoting.)*"

311,t3_c67tju,near and far - a disappointing review of the campaign and gameplay,28,"i remember the excitement, when i unwrapped the extremely heavy box on my birthday, that i had upon seeing that my wife had gotten me **near and far** for me. i had heard many great review of this game, praising the art and the story, and we couldn't wait to get a game of it in. we started the tutorial and had a blast. and the reviewer weren't kidding about the art. it wa a visual feast, with interestingly drawn characters, beautiful maps, a huge book of quests, with choice to make. it wa an absolute blast. we decided right then and there, that instead of pandemic legacy season one, we were going to play this campaign instead. and now, since we finished it last night, i can't help but say that i'm disappointed. after a few plays, you've seen literally everything the game ha to offer mechanically. you have few interesting gameplay choices, a you're routed through a routine again and again that can have some variation, but nothing that is really that interesting mechanically. but that's ok right? this game ha amazing art and is all about the story right? and it doe have some interesting lore, pulling off some very cool world-building. you'll be introduced to character who keep popping up, make interesting quest decisions, and be ever further driven towards the final goal of reaching the last map in the campaign, the lost ruins. and none of it really matters. sadly, all the quest feel like mmo sidequests, with little depth beyond making a choice for positive rep and reward or negative rep and rewards. you'll be introduced to big bads, who are built up over multiple games, finally confronting them.....only to find out they are weaker than the toughest opponent in the game, barely get a paragraph to wrap up their ""story"" and then do quest that talk about them a if they are still around. indeed, people will plead with you to perform some task that don't happen, indeed, nothing of interest happens, there is no special end of campaign wrap up, nothing that tie up the campaign and finish the story. you've just won or lost yet another game that basically played like all the others, except you could fight a bos (again, who is weaker than the toughest one you can normally encounter) and gain some vp. a some people might have noticed in my post in the ""what did you play last week"" - the game had been grating on me since about halfway through the campaign (10 games, not counting the tutorial). honestly, we probably only kept whacking at it due to sunk cost fallacy. we thought, perhaps foolishly, at the the final map would be epic. it wa just more of the same, and that samey-ness is in all aspect of the game. if there were more quest chain (easily the best part of the game), an epic finale, or quite simply ""more"" to the game, i think it could have been so great. i do want to state that we have not played any of the character game (in them, instead of doing quest based off of the map, you run through a set number of quest that deal specifically with your character) and perhaps those would have been better. i don't know, but maybe we'll eventually give them a try, maybe in a while. i will give them props, they give you plenty of variety of way to play the game, but it'll be a bit before we'll see if they are worth trying. **near and far** - it's a good enough game, but you'll see all it ha to offer long before you finish the campaign"
312,t3_c64wqe,spirit island home-brew - pt. 2 - creating the thematic design,63,"[part 1 - intro and initial research]( based spirit: * oasis * mirage * haboob/sandstorm * desert heat * cactus * desert varnish * flash flood * quicksand then i decided to figure out the play style. my initial reaction wa to embrace the antlion fantasy of gathering in invader and then destroying them. both would most likely be innate powers. in order to facilitate that, i needed a special rule (or two) that would allow the theme to come through into the mechanical realm of the game. so i settled on the following special rules: 1. presence can only be placed in the sands. 2. when presence is placed, gather 1 explorer or 1 town or 1 dahan into that same land. 1. note: the astute player will notice that there is definitely something wrong with this special rule, but we’ll get into that in a later article. then i decided to get a little weird and add one more that i thought might be interesting. * plant and water element count a sun instead. i wanted the spirit to be unique and play differently, and to me this last rule would help set it up to be different enough from the other spirit because it would most likely contain high number of sun element in it innate power element thresholds. i wa fascinated by the idea of having a spirit whose final innate power element threshold wa something around the magnitude of 10 sun element to trigger. a card that provided a sun, water, and plant symbol would instead generate 3 sun elements. you’ll see how this special rule fared in future articles. so now that i had a basic idea of special rule and some idea for innate powers, i went back to the thematic research and began crafting the unique power cards. i took the same list and jotted down idea for each thing: * oasis * remove a blight * gather invader * gather dahan * mirage * fear * gather invader * haboob/sandstorm * destroy explorer * destroy town * fear * push explorer * push town * defend * skip action * desert heat * deal damage with extra in sand * cactus * wild token * defend * desert varnish * defend * flash flood * ultimately decided against trying to describe this one since river had a flash flood card already. * quicksand * defend * wild * beast * destroy explorer * fear * singing sand dune (look it up, it’s pretty cool) * gather explorer * fear i did realize at a later date that quicksand isn’t actually a desert thing (as portrayed in movies) since it composition requires a decent amount of water, which isn’t something that desert are particularly rife with. hindsight is 20/20, so i decided to go with it at the beginning since it seemed so versatile. i’m a computer scientist by trade and i find that naming thing is incredibly difficult sometimes. a such, i waffled all over the place trying to come up with a name for this spirit. i really wanted it to have a name like shifting sand consume the lost, or shifting sand devours the doomed, but the alliteration were killing me. i threw around other weird name like shifting sand’s black blizzard, or even desert a an all consuming void (blech). it wa really hard. then i finally settled on **shifting desert’s gaping maw**. it just felt right saying it and reading it on paper, so that’s what i went with. the name ha grown on me since then and i don’t think i’ll change it. now with a name and some basic idea of thematic element i could use to bring the spirit to life, i moved on to the next step, creating the first (very rough) draft. initial idea chosen for unique power cards: * bottomless pit of quicksand * 3 cost, fast, range 1 from sand, any land * defend 4 * destroy 1 explorer * add 1 wild * elements: water/earth (water = sun) * scorch with desert heat * 2 cost, slow, range 1 from sand, any land * 1 damage * \+1 damage if target land is sand * elements: sun/fire/air * singing dune of sand * 2 cost, slow, range 1 from sand, any land * 2 fear * gather up to 2 explorer * elements: earth/sun * thrashing wall of sand * 2 cost, slow, range 1 from sand, any land * destroy 1 explorer and 1 town * elements: air/sun note: anyone who play the game regularly will most likely find some thing wrong with the above power card just with a cursory glance. again, all name are wip and most of them aren't even what i'm using now, it just go to show how dynamic and changing the process wa for me at the beginning. this article will be limited to the draft of the power card and some link on how to get your own template to use for your own purposes. here's the [power card template](-panel-play-side-template-file). a huge shout out to bgg user latzko and his amazing work in making these template (as well a the others user that have contributed to the process). note: the file are in svg (scalable vector graphic) format, so open it with whatever preferred software you have for it (photoshop or something else). i downloaded inkscape (and it's what wa recommended in latzko's post) and it ha been a useful tool if you're not opposed to free open source applications. the power card template is pretty straightforward, you just need to download it and you're good to start using it after unzipping it from the archive. just open it in inkscape (or other program) and you can start working on it. a note, you will want to install the font that come in the zip archive to get what seems to be the closest font to what is officially used. the spirit panel template's direction aren't quite a obvious. i'll list out what each file is for and the format: * part 1 - zip archive that contains the svg file, a readme to help with explaining, and 4 font archives. * part 2 - it's a 002 format, which isn't anything your computer will recognize. just put it in the same place a the svg file from part 1 * part 3 - it's a 003 format, so do the same thing. * part 4 - it's a 004 format, so do the same thing once more. after that, with everything in the same folder, you're good to just open the svg file in inkscape and go from there. latzko ha provided a wonderful tutorial on the different aspect on the template and how to use it if you have questions. so with that, i had made the (very) rough draft of the starting unique power cards. in the next article i'll walk you through the process of creating the spirit board, including growth option, presence tracks, elemental thresholds, innate powers, and the reasoning behind all of it. depending on how long that article is, i may even go into the first play-testing session where i learned that i new very little about balance. until then, see you all next time."

""well yeah,"" i reply. ""i see we are going for vp. i mean what is our purpose here? what are we trying to do?"" ""you're trying to build a empire by building structure with resource that give you bonus throughout the game,"" he force out. ""oohhhh!"" j and i let out in unison. the sword and stone and foundation all made much more sense! we continue on with the teach following along with considerable more ease. it's time to complete setup. el's hand are sweeping across the table, grabbing our starting resource and placing them on our boards. j and i being new, we weren't quite sure why we got different starting resources. it had to be explained to u again. ok moving on. j is first player, chosen by that pretty neat app on el's phone that detects everyone's finger pressed on the screen and randomly chooses fp. time to draft card (the *lookout phase*). el lay out the four (3p+1) card in front of us. before j, the first player, can absorb what ha been placed in front of her, el call out the optimal card and suggests she take that one. she pause to read the other cards, but end up choosing el's suggestion. el shift the card to me and call out the next optimal card. ""you should take this one,"" and explains why it is the best option. el's brusque disposition wa really starting to show here, most surely elevated from his fiery ardor for boardgames. ""hold on a second, man. let me see what's going on here,"" i leveled. i wanted to read these damn card and learn what type of option we would be presented with during the game. a a learner, it's important to learn what is out there a much a it is to identify ""optimal"" cards. we draft card in the opposite order, again experiencing el's declaration of the best card for u before we could read and understand any of the card placed in front of us. ok, here we go. let's just play this game and have a good time. the game get going. not long into it, i notice another antic of el's. his lower jaw is down and jutting out, chest rising and falling a air rushed into and out of his mouth, eye piercing his card a he study them. the only thing missing wa a caption hanging below his head: *[heavy breathing intensifies]*. this dude *loves* this game. a j and i place card down, el's eye get locked on our card a they are laid. he identifies the card the instant he see the front, and is again declaring to u what they mean, what we get, even which side to place the cards, and a i slide the card into place, all my resource earned have already been placed in my tableau. the game go on like this. el is moving our resource around, taking what we intend to spend and grabbing what we intend to take. his hand are in our tableau a much a he is spending in his. a few time i had to motion my hand in an attempt to slow him down and allow me to *think* through my own damn options. i didn't score a well a they did come game end. i owe part of that due to refusing to play his suggestion out of my own frustration from his intrusive ""facilitation"" of the game. i didn't have that great of a time and i likely will avoid his table from this point on. so to my boardgame community i say, it's fine if your heart rate climb when you hear that cardboard fart when opening up your favorite game. it is certainly a good thing to show the world all the awesome game it ha never played. but fuck me, if you want them to have a good time and you want to ensure they know *how*--and want--to play the game next time around, get your damn hand off their token and game pieces, know when to bite your tongue and let them think--and act--for themselves (unless they are struggling or ask), and *let. them. fucking. play.* funny enough, i vented to my partner and he immediately reminded me of how he had to tell me in the past not to place my hand in any way on his side of the table due to pretty much the same reasons. so i am guilty too, but i'm more woke now following that game night. i will make every effort to allow newbie to a game their own physical and mental space for maximum enjoyment. thanks for reading. **edit:** i'll acknowledge the personal element here and say that it isn't necessary for my testimony. i'll leave it in here for readers' reference but i will admit it wasn't necessary to convey my main message. i wa trying to paint a picture, and i chose the wrong way to do it. el, you showed up in this thread. i apologize for the personal attack, but my message still stands. i don't think that should change now that you saw this post. like i said, a lot of u are guilty in letting our excitement get the best of us, and it may become overbearing to others when we forget to slow down and let new player truly experience the game. i, particularly, enjoy the try-fail-experiment-succeed element of learning a game. i don't want to know the best move, i want to learn my way there. i think some here will identify with that. it just wasn't a good pairing of teacher-learner style and thought i'd offer to the community, by example, a teaching style that is adverse to the learners' experience."

(maybe 2 people can do each action? maybe a worker placement, but i don't think so). * the middle of the board play area/action is step you have to climb (2d, so really just move forward on) and you're trying to make it to the top each round to like maybe pay respect to the emperor/king so you can score each round. this part is very important because everyone each round ha to make it to a certain point in this area or they don't get point or something bad happens. * in one of the corner (bottom right?) there's a windy track player move along and this track is used for tie breaking during the game. there are many time where tie breaking is needed and the person furthest along on this track win the ties. there are 2 checkpoint on this track (green gems) and you move forward and backward because you use something. * green(??) gem are like rare or important or something (i don't think there are other color gems, just this one gem). * in another area you can hire people/abilities which are represented by small square (maybe 1in x 1in) cardboard. one of the people/abilities give you a permanent discount for the game, 1 give you more points, etc... you can hire multiple people / get multiple special thing but i think there were only 2 of each special thing so there wa a bit of a race to get these. they were pretty expensive though so you had to build up some kind of currency a bit first. i think that's about all i have. i brought this up at game night last night and nobody could think of it (thanks to my terrible recollection) so i don't have high hope but figured i'd try here. **edit**: solved!"

a tabletop gaming ha started to gain newfound traction, with fan flocking to kickstarter to express their support, the want for ‘more stuff’ is increasing in demand. gloomhaven, for example, rose to the highest rank of boardgamegeek by fulfilling the promise of a dungeon-crawling campaign that could take literally year to complete. smaller, bitesize cardboard experience may not be quite a complex or immersive a their expansive big-boy-box counterparts, but there are some that manage to be incredibly rewarding, without requiring you to sacrifice an entire evening for the pleasure. in the first of this series of collated board game micro-reviews, i want to look at a few game both big and small that attempt to strike a delicate balance between content and engagement, for those who want to be a efficient a possible with their tabletop time. #x200b; **big - star wars: rebellion** never trust a board game by it suggested playtime. i have failed to heed my own advice too many time when bringing this game to the table. 2-4 hour seems like all the time this cat-and-mouse race through space should need, what could possibly go wrong? one player or team of two take command of the massively overpowered empire, attempting to locate and blow up the rebel base, controlled by the rebels, who are simply trying to survive. there’s a set amount of round in the game, which the rebel can reduce by completing special objectives, but there’s such a variety of cool-sounding thing to do every round that it can take an exceedingly long time to plan and execute. while the thinking-phase of the game can vary in length depending on player experience, the combat is a persistent drag. despite being logistically simple, the sheer amount of fiddliness with token and identifying damage done based on the colour of the die rolled mean that it frequently brings the game to a grinding halt. that said, the asymmetric design of the game is relatively flawless: the rebel have weaker force but are able to constantly undermine the empire, who struggle to pin them down despite their strength in numbers. this tension aptly match the tone of the conflict in the star war universe. verdict: rebellion is relatively easy to pick up and play, but the brainpower required to outwit your opponent can too often result in epic that take longer to resolve than a trilogy of films. for everything there is to love about the vast majority of the experience, it can’t help but feel like a slog by the end. the combat definitely doesn’t help. #x200b; **small - love letter** like the early season of game of thrones, this isn’t about thrilling battles, epic dragons, and illogical plot development - this is about sordid romantic conspiracy and tactical mastermind deceiving their ally to distract from what’s hidden up their sleeve. a a player you attempt to unveil and eliminate all other possible suitor of a princess until one lover is left standing, or by ending a round with the closest connection to the princess (a.k.a holding the highest number card). you only have two card available to use on your turn, each with a number value and a special effect that can either help or hinder. the challenge of this game is avoiding letting others learn the content of your hand, a that is the easiest way to secure a rival’s elimination. there are no opportunity for temporary allegiances, meaning no one can be trusted at any time. instead, this game allows you to expose how your friend behave when smuggling the truth under pressure. verdict: this game ha been tough to recommend to friends, despite it’s 5-15 minute playtime, because the rule don’t seem a easy a other compact experiences. but whenever i can convince a group to give it a go, it’s great for testing your mates’ poker faces, and fun for anyone who enjoys some simple sexy subterfuge. #x200b; **big - gloomhaven** this is a mammoth game that succeeds at taking player on a sprawling campaign featuring a unique and engaging selection of playable classes, varied yet easy-to-learn mechanics, and inventive way of repurposing a vast core set of components. there are so many boards, props, minions, etc, that the game can be a challenge to setup and initially organise, but these many different part ensure that no two game are the same. you are part of a guild trying to survive in the city of gloomhaven and the surrounding wilds. over the course of 100 or so mission (with objective such a ‘kill all monster on the board’ or ‘escort the npc from one corner of the board to another), player create and retire several character a they follow a non-linear story in a world that gradually reveals itself. this is the closest thing to d’n’d in a box, without the need for a gm. the overarching player/character development feel like a video game a you upgrade abilities, make moral choices, and find more loot, while the main gameplay is a cross between cooperative card gaming and strategic turn-based combat. this is all confined to scenario that individually won’t take more than an hour or two to complete, without requiring much commitment from occasional players. the story isn’t going to win any awards, but it is satisfyingly fun context for any guild of adventurers. verdict: i have invested more time into this game than any other, with more than half of the content remaining locked to me. if you can find a way to ease the process of setup, this is a game that you will want to bring back to the table to continue your adventures, with a flexibility of playtime that can last an entire day or just a couple of hours. #x200b; **small - exploding kittens** another kickstarter success story, this game is about a brief a a game of russian roulette, and just a intense... well, almost. exploding kitten is about luck, screwing other people over, and avoiding the ever-present threat of sudden death by fiery feline. in the oatmeal’s tabletop debut, you either win or you die. on a turn, you play a many card a you wish before ending your go by drawing a card. if that card happens to be an exploding kitten, you’re out of the game unless you have the mean to defuse it. a simple concept that carves out easy conflict between you and your competitor a everyone try to avoid drawing cards, especially if all player suspect that a recently defused kitten might have been returned to the top of the deck by a near-‘sploded player. verdict: this is the preferred choice by most of my friend a the easiest game to get out for a quick game or several. it’s a refreshing outlet for friend to take turn at attacking one another while trying to turn the increasingly unlikely odds in their favour. #x200b; **big - batman: gotham city chronicles** this game and it jam-packed expansion can easily total a small fortune for anyone who want to invest in the full collection. it’s incredibly immersive and wonderfully detailed for any dc fan, but that come at the cost of time-consuming complexity. surely this is the perfect case in point for my argument - that perhaps le is more and we need to refrain from buying into these deliciously complex collection of combat-ready figurines. in a single game, one player take the mantle of the villains, while the others each pick a hero and proceed to complete specific objectives. all of the character and scenario have their own feature and contextual effects, to create an excessively detailed world for friend to showdown within. it really is a smorgasbord of delight for any dark knight fan. considering how many rule apply to the vast array of playable character and scenario available in the base game alone, it’s hard to say whether it would take longer to learn the game than the estimated 4 hour required to play a scenario. not to mention that each playable character requires learning an relatively unique skill set prior to each game and, unlike gloomhaven, these mission don’t contribute to a grander narrative. then again... this is the only streamlined batman tabletop experience outside of the even more elaborate batman miniature game. for some, that alone might be worth it. verdict: i don’t know if i can recommend it. but i know that i want it. #x200b; **small - munchkin** munchkin offer a deluxe edition with a board that serf a a basic visual guide, but really this is a compact tabletop card game that prof you don’t need endless piece of plastic for an adequate adventure with satisfying competition and character development. your goal is to reach level 10. to gain a level, you must defeat a monster. the game encourages strategy and conversation by giving you the option to work with or against each other. player can either assist you in combat, in exchange for a share of the rewards, or they might side with the monster to make life even harder for you this game manages to maintain the depth of a classic dungeon crawler and strip out all the faff thanks to it reliance on a simple card-based system to create a variety of quick encounter and with reward that progress your character. the experience is designed to give player a taste of what pen-and-paper rpgs consist of, in only a fraction of the time. verdict: a perfectly compact excerpt of what player desire from classic rpgs without unnecessary role-playing and fiddliness, which can be started and wrapped up within the same hour, or played on repeat for a satisfying full evening of dungeoneering. #x200b; **in conclusion (the long and short of it)** there are stark difference between long hefty tabletop experience and their condensed counterparts, a well a the type of audience they specifically appeal to. game that last several hour are typically test of endurance and brainpower, testing player logistical ability to evolve their strategy based on the way the opponent is developing. despite the draw of these exhaustive game to experienced players, the game that stand the test of time and get brought back to the table are those that respect your time, allow you to improve your skills, and provide unique experience with each new game. whereas the game that last several hour absolutely require that you are with a group of people that are equally a committed to playing a you are, shorter game are great for playing with people you want to know better, or want to gauge the interest of before proposing an 8 hour twilight imperium campaign. the best of these will expose something about the deeper personality of the people around you in a microcosm, with the real challenge being how you read other player rather than rebut their actions. they are often perfect ice breaker or time-fillers for social occasion with friend and stranger alike, rather than being the sole focus of an entire evening (or longer). #x200b;

407,t3_c7hakl,need help remembering strategy card game,15,"okay, a few year ago i played this game at a party and really liked it, now i don't remember the name of it. #x200b; it wa turn-based. we had four player but i think you can do 3-6. each player started with a hand of cards, maybe 5 or 6. there wa a mat/board where card could be discarded/staged. i believe the object of the game wa to run out of cards, but i might be wrong. it had a medieval/magic/pastoral type theme. different card had different values/abilities and could affect the other players, like causing them to lose a turn or pick up additional card from the deck, kind of like uno, but it wa more strategic than that. there wasn't combat per se, but i seem to recall that certain character card had advantage over others in certain scenarios. #x200b; i would describe it a a cross between risk and uno, with some magic thrown in for good measure. #x200b; any idea what i'm talking about? if i had to guess, this game came out in the last 10-15 years. i have looked all over amazon and my local game store. thanks! #x200b; edit: i remembered some more detail about the gameplay. at the beginning of each player's turn, you get to decide what card(s) to use, i don't recall any dice but there is an element where each card ha a certain value (say 3 or 5) and you can use up to a maximum value (say 10) on any turn with any combination of cards. again, i think the object of the game is discard your entire hand. edit! i'm pretty sure it's **dominion**, but i'm not sure what edition. actually, i'm positive, it wa dominion. thanks all for the help!

420,t3_c7s2pn,spirit island home-brew - pt. 3 - the first rough draft and play-test,16,"[part 1 - intro and initial research]() today's article will be a little shorter than normal to make up for the huge amount of content that will be included in the next one. now that i had a giant list of thematic element and number to draw from, it became time to create the first draft of shifting desert’s spirit board **innate powers** it wa obvious from the start that i wanted one innate power to be gathering and one to be devouring. so here wa my first stab at the innate powers: * the ravenous hunger devours * slow, range 0, sand only * threshold #1: 1 earth, 1 air, 1 sun * deal 2 damage. * threshold #2: 3 earth, 2 air, 3 sun * instead, deal 4 damage. * threshold #3: 5 earth, 3 air, 4 sun * instead, deal 10 damage. * mirage lead to certain demise * fast, range 0, sand only * threshold #1: 3 sun * gather 1 explorer. * threshold #2: 6 sun * gather 1 town. * threshold #3: 1 air * for each air you may repeat the power (different land are ok) note: i wa about to learn about the nuance of gathering by making this spirit. **presence tracks** i decided i wanted to mimic something similar to vital strength of the earth with play style. this meant low card play and high amount of energy. this lends itself well to playing major power later in the game. since i still wanted to trigger the innate power with relatively few card plays, i needed to add element to the presence tracks. this proved to be a lot more difficult than i had originally thought. this explains why all the low complexity spirit don’t have element on their presence tracks, which is actually a hard rule set by the designers. so here’s my first attempt at the layout of the presence track on the spirit panel: * energy track: * 2 sun 4 sun 6 air 8 9 * card play track: * 1 earth 2 earth/reclaim-1 air 3 **growth options** here’s what i came up with for the growth options: * reclaim all, gain a power card * add a presence (r3), gain a power card * add a presence (r0), gain 2 energy and +2 more per sun showing * note: this could net a maximum of 6 energy when all sun symbol were showing. in my mind, there were enough element to get the innate power triggered assuming all 3 card play had earth symbol on them and if there were any plant or water element on the cards, i should have plenty of sun element to trigger the other innate power. with that, the spirit (rough draft) wa complete. i put it all into effect on a template in inkscape and printed it out, eager for my first game to see how i did. **the first play-test** we played a 2-player game of difficulty 4 of brandenburg-prussia to see how it held up against a slightly harder version of the base game. my wife played river (she always randomizes which spirit she play unless we’re doing something insane like higher level england). a we played through the game and eventually won, i wa furiously taking note on the spirit panel of thing that i noticed and thing i wanted to experiment with and change. here’s a summary of what i learned from the first play-test: **special rules:** * gathering when placing presence a a special rule is definitely too powerful. it completely invalidates build and explore action in their entirety with no cost to the player. * it could be interesting if it wa only gathering thing like dahan, beasts, or other things. * the ravenous hunger devours (innate power #1) felt good, but wasn’t enough to deal with everything. * it wa also too hard to trigger anything beyond the first threshold. * mirage lead to certain demise (innate power #2) felt really good thematically, but wa too powerful in practice. most likely wa because it wa a fast power. slowing it down would help me understand how it should be balanced. * repeating this power with 1 air made the game trivial. if i wanted to gather multiple invaders, i wa going to have to earn it. **presence tracks:** * definitely needed to redo the presence tracks. the element came at strange time and didn’t make sense. * it seemed like i wa just trying to avoid repetition on the track (i.e. 2 2 2 3 4 5) and opted to fill the “useless” space with element instead. it didn’t work out the way i had hoped. * the energy gain wa too high and energy wa never an issue, even in the early stage (also a fault of the growth options). **growth options:** * gaining 2 per sun element showing wa definitely too powerful. * considered changing it to a passive gain 3 with another 1 per sun instead. * or removing that component of it entirely. **unique power cards:** * bottomless pit of quicksand * it felt weird to add wilds, destroy an explorer, and defend 4. there were instance where i’d play the card just to put a wild down. that didn’t feel good at all. * i did like having a defensive ability, but i think there is a better way to implement one. * scorch with desert heat * it felt like it should either cost 1 energy or be fast * the rest of it felt good. * singing dune of sand * i liked the thematic part of it, but gathering 2 explorer (even slow) wa too powerful and essentially negated the explore action (and therefore the subsequent build and ravage actions). * doing all of that and adding 2 fear wa definitely too much. * thrashing wall of sand * again, this accompanied with everything else made it so that i only had to deal with explorer and towns. the invader couldn’t ever get a hold long enough to build a city throughout the entirety of the game. **general thoughts:** * turn out gathering a a fast power is really powerful. i gained a new respect for all power card that gather or push fast. to be fair, gathering multiple thing even a a slow power is incredibly powerful a well. so there you have it. the spirit wa definitely too powerful for it own good. i nixed the special rule about gathering after the first round. it wa obvious that it wa too powerful after the first time i did it. you can learn a lot from a single play-test and anyone who ha ever made a game will tell you that it take dozen (perhaps even hundreds) of play-tests and iteration before you come up with a solid design. next time i’ll talk about some advice i read from the designer that really changed my outlook on thing and how my entire mindset shifted a a result. any thought or thing that stuck out to you? i'd love to discuss!"

426,t3_c7rj5m,antike ii worth getting?,10,"i'm wondering if anyone can share some thought about antike ii. i'm relatively new to the hobby but have found myself to be a big fan of mac gerdts. i have concordia and navegador and they are two of my favourite games. i find them to have fantastically smooth flow, interesting decision without excessive complexity and elegant, interlocking mechanisms. in concordia, i love the variable setup with the city and available card a well a the card play. navegador ha the wonderful market and rondel systems. both have great use of scoring multipliers. i'm wondering whether or not i will like antike ii. it seems to be the next most-recommended game by this designer apart from imperial (/2030) which i'd rather avoid for a few reason (don't like the theme, not a big fan of stock-ownership game or the idea of indirect control over countries). antike ii seems to be quite a different beast in term of it inherent direct conflict and race to fulfill victory conditions. the group i play with tend to be more on the ""care bear"" side of thing and prefer the passive conflict of euro games. i worry about non-aggressive player getting ""shut-out"" of the game and having a bad time. i also wonder if, a an older game, despite the 2014 update, the mechanism may feel a little dated and dry. on the other hand, i'm hoping the game might have the smoothness and tight design of the other mac gerdts game i've tried. is this game still getting a lot of play for you? doe the combat avoid being too arbitrary or ""take-that""? is it possible to thrive with a non-combat strategy? is the game too intimidating or un-fun for newbies? doe the game play ok at 3 (my most common player count) or doe it really need the 5 recommended by bgg? is there another mac gerdts game you'd recommend? some of my other favourite game are terra mystica, terraforming mars, tigris and euphrates, scythe, caverna and hansa teutonica. would be very grateful for any of your thoughts!"

436,t3_c7myzo,[comc] my collection after 2 year,23,"they're usually more organized than this but here is my 2 year collection. not pictured is 7 wonders: duel which is at a friend's house. also not pictured is dd core books,10 magic guild kit decks, ton of star wars: destiny cards/dice, some pokemon stuff and some more keyforge stuff (i really like card games). and fireball island is on the way. a you can see, most of my collection fall in the light-medium range because that's mostly the audience i play with. i'll probably stop at 100 game and will definitely be adding some heavier hitter like brass and eclipse but for now keeping it on the lighter side. if i had to get rid of 10 game though they would probably be: last night on earth, tiny epic western, vault wars, ar alchimia, dude, nyet!, arkham horror lcg, valley of the kings, oceanos, and maybe flick em up. #x200b; lnoe because while i think the character and mini's are really cool, there's just better zombie game out at this point so i'd probably swap it for dead of winter or zombicide. tiny epic western because the game doesn't really intrigue me that much and i haven't had the urge to play it more than a couple times. vault wars...still never played it so maybe i should before i get rid of it. ar alchimia wa an impulse buy that i also haven't played but i like the manga style artwork. dude is a one trick pony and i have better party game but this game is great to play with a table full of drunk people. nyet! is a solid trick taking game and the art is great but i want a little bit more out of it, maybe i'll play it some more before selling. arkham horror lcg is a great game but i don't have anyone to play it with to make buying past the core box worth it and it just a lot of money to sink into one game, even if it is good. valley of the king is a very unique deckbuilder but the art is just...bad. oceanos is like baby 7 wonder and it a solid drafting game but after 10 play it not that interesting to me. flick em up is a game that i think sound great in theory and then in practice it kind of a mixed bag (this is the plastic one though so that could be why). #x200b; recent game i'm really stoked on are chronicle of crime, decrypto and welcome to. what do you think of the game i want to get rid of? agree? or should i keep some? i'd love to hear your opinion because i feel like i haven't given some of those game a fair chance. #x200b; [)"

485,t3_c87gkw,one bad board game session ha killed my desire to play,33,"sorry for the neggy post folks, this should be a happy place for happy experiences. unfortunately, saturday's gaming session ha left me feeling pretty jaded. what wa supposed to be a whole day dedicated to gaming quickly devolved in to a complete drunken mess, with myself being the only sober person. last minute addition to our group quickly derailed our session, game component were dropped all over the floor, rule were ignored and i wa left trying to steer a group of seemingly disinterested people through a simple game of camel up, before calling it a day early and heading home. i left feeling like the lame or ""uncool"" one for wanting to actually **do** the thing we had arranged in the first place, rather than just get drunk. all i wanted to do wa pack the game up and head home, but i wa stuck in the position of either being a party pooper and creating an awkward atmosphere, or biting my tongue and trying to rush the game to it's natural conclusion. i settled on the latter. it wa a sad moment when the game ended a round early and the group barely noticed a i threw the component back in the box to get it off the table a quickly a possible. since then, i've completely lost my desire to play at all. i absolutely hated the feeling i had of trying to force a game on people, and i'd rather not risk it again. but i love playing board games. i feel so much envy when i read of your experience with like-minded people who love to play a much a you. ha anybody else had a bad experience crush their motivation to play? did you eventually bounce back?"

498,t3_c8l2x0,impression of that's pretty clever (ganz schön clever) - the roll-and-write game finally grows up,16,"ever since yahtzee, and probably ever since dice existed and people could start drawing line in the sand, roll-and-write game have been popular. despite it popularity, yahtzee often get dismissed quite quickly by gamers looking for more decisions. enter qwixx, a dice game from 2012, which brought all player into the game - even when it wasn't your turn. it won a lot of awards, and helped bring back the roll-and-write game into the spotlight. but qwixx wa still a very light game, and that's where **that's pretty clever** (2018) come in. originally called **ganz schön clever**, this game is clever. but it's also addictive, fast, and fun. and perhaps most importantly for gamers: it ha depth. **game-play** the game-play seems familiar at first - you're rolling dice, keeping some, and re-rolling. but what make that's pretty clever especially interesting is that you'll enter the dice you roll into coloured areas, trying to set yourself up to score chain of point later in the game. and you need to think about the fact that any dice you don't use yourself have the potential to be used by other players. it's ever so addictive, and once you grok the game-play, you'll find yourself playing it over and over, in your quest to get the highest score. in fact, you'll like it that much, that you'll probably even play it on your own. **impressions** that's pretty clever is an outstanding roll-and-write game, and deserves all the praise it ha received. it won't be for everyone, because it's not the light and carefree filler that it first appears to be. so if you're expecting a simple yahtzee style game, you'll be in for somewhat of a surprise. but this is exactly why it wa nominated for the kennerspiel de jahres, and not the more family-friendly spiel de jahres award. the fun in this game lie in the combos, and you'll need to plan ahead to try to set these up, which involves some real crunchiness. there's still some luck, since it's a dice game after all, and this will at time frustrate you. but the game is engaging enough - especially once you start hitting some combo - to keep you come back to it, over and over! despite the absence of theme, the real appeal here is how it creates the feel of being an engine builder, while remaining a relatively simple dice game. you're doing much more than just pushing your luck, like in most roll-and-write dice games. instead you're drafting dice in a way that is ... well ... clever! this may make it a little more meaty than what the average family or non-gamer is prepared to handle, but gamers will lap it up. expect some tough decision making, which will prove especially rewarding a you start triggering chain of points. i wouldn't suggest playing with more than 3 players, due to the risk of down-time, but for 2-3 player it's just perfect. the solo option and app are fantastic a well. **recommendation** ha the roll-and-write finally grown up? unsurprisingly, that's pretty clever ha been a huge hit ever since it came out in 2018, and ha been nominated for some big awards, including the 2018 kennerspiel de jahre. it also went on to win the golden geek for 2018 best solo board game. and it continued success is guaranteed with a new edition now available from american publisher stronghold games. just when you thought that the roll-and-write category had exhausted it potential, something new like that's pretty clever (2018) show up to surprise us. along with it sequel twice a clever (2019), these are very welcome addition to the rank of roll-and-move games, especially for gamers. ***where to get it?*** *that's pretty clever is now available from the publisher stronghold game (*[*here*]()*)*."

510,t3_c8dai9,first impression of root (and what i think critic are missing),31,"so, with two playthroughs of root under my belt (the first game will be a learning game, guaranteed), i feel like i can provide a little insight into some of the conflicting review of this game. first and foremost: this game is not for non-gamers, at least not for people who aren't excited about playing. the rule aren't incredibly difficult, but they add up, and keeping track of other player faction is near impossible for someone who isn't invested. this is actually where i think a few critic have gone wrong. this game is meant to be played a a light game for wargamers, or a heavy game for area control gamers. yes, this game will be completed in 2 hour or less, but there is a lot of depth here that isn't immediately apparent. i must talk about my biggest flaw, or buying consideration, about this game after playing a couple times. like susd said in their review, this game operates on the continuous balancing by player in term of taking down the leader. there need to be an understanding of who is winning and why, or else the game will never be satisfying. this lead to one reality i've discovered: you really have to play this game with the same people. i've played just twice, and if we were to swap one of the player in our group with a smart gamer who hadn't played, this player would be forced to trust u when we told them who wa in the lead and why it wa their responsibility to stop them. in something like kemet, the vps are easily trackable, and there's only a couple way to get them. in root, you have to track everyone else's game and way of winning. it is so heavily asymmetrical, the burden of engagement is extremely high. the thing is, i would not say this is to the detriment of the game. i appreciate a high buy in of engagement, and i won't knock a game for new player being disadvantaged. however, this all produce a very particular type of game flow and play experience: whether to it's detriment or not, root is a game of constantly trying to score point while harming the leader, and the person who win will often be the one who played an absolutely mediocre game until the very end. sometimes, there are runaway leader because people are too focused on their own faction (this will almost certainly happen in your first game). but more often, you will play a game of root in which the winner never did anything ""crazy"" or ""awesome"". i know it's my first two plays, but from what i've read elsewhere online and what i've seen on yt playthroughs, my experience seems pretty consistent with others. feel free to let me know if you disagree. my first impression of root is actually positive, believe it or not. the production is the best i've ever seen at this price point, and the humdrum of managing your faction is actually quite fun and interesting, even if it's not highlighted by rush of adrenaline or ""big-brain plays"". i've enjoyed my first two plays, and look forward to playing more. moving forward, my biggest concern is the crunch of each individual faction. could i play the same faction 10 time and have more fun each time, is there true depth to these factions? this is what i'll have to discover moving forward. please, let me know your impression and thought of root either early, or with many game under your belt."

542,t3_c8mtja,a coop game discussion,15,"i had a discussion the other day, inspired by a coop game (gen7) and i'd like to see what people think about it. the discussion came from the game being increasingly complicated, and from situation arising where we needed to exactly plan out a round in detail before even taking the first action. a few time during this and previous sessions, i felt that the situation can get a bit too complicated, and in those case we should put a threshold on how much we discuss, and accept that there may be le than optimal plays. another player thought that we should dedicate a few more minute to analyze the situation and reach a conclusion instead. during the discussions, we focused on the following aspect of the issue. * i felt that some players, including me, get tired from the cognitive load of presenting and analyzing all option some time (especially when we discus for a few minute and then we realize that we forgot a parameter and the discussion need to restart, etc.). the other player said that that's fine, in that case the player who are tired can step back and let the rest, who still enjoy it, figure out the situation and let them know what to do. * i pointed out that being told what to do is taking away the joy of the game to an extent, since at that point it stop being a cooperative experience. it's the alpha player problem. the other player said that being forced to stop figuring out the optimal solution is also taking away the joy of the game, the whole point is to gather and figure out the solution to the situation presented, together (those who want and can do it at each point). they also thought that another player who wa in this situation wa probably happy to step back and let the rest figure it out. * note that during most of the game we all participate in the discussion and problem solving, it's only a few time when we reach the point where i think we're past the threshold, so take the sentence in the previous point to be about occasional time during play, and not the entirety of it. * the other player also said that if the majority of the people around the table feel like i do, and don't want to step back, then the other player would agree to stop analyzing and get on with the game, but they feel it's not that much of a problem for anyone who get tired to step back for a few minutes, since otherwise their own reason to play get taken away involuntarily. to me it seems that the above way to look at this situation are at odds and can't be fully reconciled. of course, depending on how pronounced they are in the game, they can be overcome by small compromise, perhaps. have you run into this problem? what do you think should be done? do you have tip to resolve this situation?"

562,t3_c8xd78,need help identifying game where you grab bone off a table after collecting a set of card,7,"hi guys, had very fond memory playing this game in board game cafe with a group of close friend many year back, and i've been trying to hunt it down recently. what i recall is that there are a mess of card on the table, and the objective of the game is to complete a full set of card of one type (i vaguely recall it may be dinosaur themed, but i might be wrong) either through putting down x card and picking up x cards, or trading x card with someone else (again can't remember if it's either mechanic or both). the crucial part of the game though, is there are a number of rubber bone on the table, totaling one le than the number of player playing, i.e. if there are 7 player playing there will be 6 bones. once someone ha completed a set of cards, he/she will then discreetly take a bone from the table. for everyone else, once they notice one of the bone is missing, they have to immediately snatch up a bone too, until there are no more bone at the table (at which point the person who didn't grab a bone is the loser). this wa always hilarious fun a we would pretend to keep searching for card even after all the bone were gone, and there wa invariably one person who would keep frantically trying to complete their set long after all the bone had been collected. would appreciate any help identifying this game! thanks!"

570,t3_c9bvtb,impression of twice a clever (doppelt so clever) - the hottest roll-and-write dice game just became deeper!,21,"***the hottest roll-and-write dice game just became a more satisfying and deeper experience!*** in recent years, the genre of roll-and-write game ha been enjoying something of a resurgence. despite it haters, game like yahtzee (1956) have always been popular. so rather than criticize this old chestnut for it fault or limitations, why not piggyback on it success, and use it a a stepping stone to introduce fan to the newer generation of roll-and-write games? this class includes the award-winning qwixx (2012), which ha everyone involved even on other player's turns. then come **that's pretty clever** (2018), which is a much more meaty game geared to satisfy gamers. it ha made a big splash, and ha proven very popular. many gamers will insist that it is their favourite roll-and-write game ever! like most dice games, it's fast, fun, and addictive, but it add element of real strategy and depth. and now the following year, along come it sequel, **twice a clever** (2019), with both game being brought to the american market by publisher stronghold games. like the original, this new title come from designer wolfgang warsch, and is a dice-rolling game for 1-4 players, playable in under half an hour. **game-play** the rule of twice a clever are basically the same a that's pretty clever, a you're rolling and re-rolling dice, marking off square in your scoring grid. what's different, however, is a new silver die that let you score with multiple dice, and also a new power. the result is an even more deep and strategic game! if you liked that's pretty clever, but wanted an even greater challenge, then twice a clever is the perfect game for you. you'll love this just a much - or if the title is any indication, perhaps twice a much! **impressions** that's pretty clever wa rightly praised a being a terrific roll-and-write game. what gave it appeal to gamers wa that it offered so much more than standard dice-rolling filler like yahtzee. now twice a clever (2019) ha come along, offering an even more meaty experience. it continues the successful formula of the original, and if you really enjoyed that, you're likely to enjoy this too. the basic concept that made the original game great ha been retained, and what ha been added are some new scoring possibility and features. these make it an even more thoughtful and satisfying experience for those who like to really chew on their decisions. if you're only going to get one of these games, you should make your decision based on your preferred level of complexity and depth. twice a clever certainly offer the deeper experience of the two, so if it's a more strategic and meaty game that you are looking for, then this is likely going to be the one you enjoy the most. even then, you will probably get the most out of it by starting with that's pretty clever, playing that over and over until you're ready for a new challenge, and only then moving up to twice a clever. on the other hand if you're more likely to enjoy a lighter-medium weight game, then that's pretty clever is probably the game to get anyway. while it depth might scare off some gateway gamers, it can also be ideal for the purpose of bringing newcomer to the fold. either way, that's pretty clever is the place that almost everyone should start with, and if you really love it, then you can always move up to twice a clever when you want to step up the level of complexity, while offering more of the same style of game-play. **recommendation** both of these game are great addition to the gaming market. it's wonderful to see the roll-and-write genre being invigorated and populated by title that don't sacrifice depth of thought. while light dice-rolling filler like yahtzee will always be popular in the mass market, it's good to see that there are solid option in the roll-and-write category for gamers a well. and you can't do much better than that's pretty clever and it sequel twice a clever. especially for gamers, i recommend them both very highly! ***where to get it?*** *twice a clever is now available from the publisher stronghold game (*[*here*]()*)*."

583,t3_c922pk,spirit island home-brew - pt. 4 - back to the drawing board,46,"[part 1 - intro and initial research]( * **part 2 - special rule(s):** * only place presence in sands. * i wa fine with this, i like the limited range aspect of the spirit, it give it some obvious flaw that it will have to find a way around in the future. * gather when presence is placed. * here’s where we run into some problems. it wa obvious from the first play-test that this special rule wa too powerful. the thematic fantasy of the spirit wa already being fulfilled by the second innate power, so i didn’t need to add it into the special rule a well. * convert plant and water into sun * i liked the idea, but wa a little strange in execution. it also meant that my spirit could never help with certain event that arose during play. that felt bad, so this needed to be changed a well. so a you can see, i wa stopped on only step 2 of 8, revealing to me that i needed to work on the fundamental once more before i moved on to the actual number-tweaking and other intricate part of balance. i brainstormed for quite a while on special rule that would help the spirit be interesting, but not overpowered. i settled on removing the 2nd and 3rd special rule and adding in a variant of the 3rd one. it would still do what i wanted, but to a more controllable/interactive level. **you may pay x energy to gain x sun elements** that sounded a lot better to me and removing the original gathering special rule wa an obvious choice anyway. this would still allow me to have larger count of sun element and would put the energy i wa gaining to good use. now i wa able to move on to the next piece. * **part 3 - innate powers** * i analyzed the innate power and decided to shift the elemental threshold around. i gave the devour innate power all the earth element and the gathering innate power all of the sun elements. * i made the gathering innate power slow and placed a limit on it by forcing the player to pay energy (a la the special rule) to be able to gather invaders. so now they looked like this: * the ravenous hunger devours * slow, range 0, any * threshold #1: 1 earth, 1 sun * deal 2 damage. * threshold #2: 3 earth 1 air, 3 sun * instead, deal 6 damage. * threshold #3: 5 earth 2, air, 5 sun * instead, deal 12 damage. * notes: for each town or city destroyed by this effect, +1 fear. * mirage lead to certain demise * fast, range 0, any * threshold #1: 3 sun, 1 air * gather 1 explorer per sun * threshold #2: 6 sun, 2 air * gather 1 town per 2 sun. * threshold #3: 10 sun, 4 air * gather all explorer or towns. * threshold #4: 5 air * you may repeat the power. with a new set of innate power that seemed harder to reach, but just a rewarding for doing so (or so i thought), i moved on to the next part. * **part 4 - unique power cards:** * bottomless pit of quicksand - blinding sandstorm * 3 cost, fast, range 1, any land * invader skip all action in target land this turn. * elements: sun/air/earth * scorch with desert heat * 2-1 cost, slow, range 1, any land * 1 damage * \+1 damage if target land is sand * elements: sun/fire/air - sun/fire * singing dune of sand - grit and gravel chip away * 1 cost, slow, range 1, any land * 1 damage to each town/city. * elements: earth/fire * thrashing wall of sand - smothering wall of sand * 2 cost, slow, range 1, any land * 1 fear. * push up to 3 explorers/towns/dahan or destroy 1 town. * elements: air/fire/earth/sun the unique power card changed the most since i wasn’t happy with how most of them played in the first play-test. turn out i still had a lot to learn when it come to crafting unique power card in general in term of effect and balance. these would continue to change and fluctuate from this point all the way to the end of the balancing cycle. * **part 5 - growth options:** * reclaim all, gain a power card - reclaim all, gain 1 energy, gain earth or sun * add a presence (range 3), gain a power card. * add a presence (range 0), gain 2 energy. shifting desert isn’t primarily an earth spirit, so i didn’t want the reclaim to be terribly strong. but it ha earth a the secondary element, so i wanted it to be slightly better than some reclaim all combinations. part 6 through 8 are for play-testing, so i’m not going to go into that any more in this article. so now you’ve seen how a lot of thing can be revealed when play-testing what you’ve created. these revelation can in turn change a lot of the design of your spirit (especially when your fundamental aren’t in place completely). i recommend anyone who want to make their own spirit follow the advice given above. it make the process more streamlined and help to identify problem earlier in the design. next time will be the final article where i reveal what i consider to be the (nearly) finished spirit and give tip for how to play-test efficiently in addition to a smattering of lesson that i learned that i think will be useful to everyone else who attempt something like this."

(the highest merchant becomes the lesser dalmuti. everyone else move up, except merchant and peons) this make it more fun to be a peon and add a guessing game to the dalmuti gameplay with additional mind games. now if you made it this far thank you for reading. i came up with a way for the royalty to shoo a jester away before the jester activate. the three card in the game are called the earl marshall’s. but in this variant, one of them is called the supreme earl marshall and this card can get rid of a jester that ha entered the castle. i’m not sure exactly when it get rid of a jester that ha entered the castle. maybe after it is played? or who ever ha played the supreme earl marshall, can decided whether to shoo a jester away at the end of the game. what do you think or recommend? final question. i’m curious to hear your thoughts, if both jester are in the castle at the end of the round, what happens? doe the dalmuti pick one (hoping he pick the good fortune jester) or do both jester cancel each other out. i like the dalmuti picking one. what are your thoughts? i am very excited to play test this."
594,t3_c8xmcn,how much have you spent on this hobby?,81,"see title. out of curiosity, i copied my bgg collection into an excel file and listed my expense in this hobby since i’ve started. most of my receipt are available either in my email, on amazon, or on target. there were only a handful that i had to guess price for. i’ve been collecting for about 4-5 year now. my bgg collection sits at 110, including expansions. minus expansion i have 67 games. i estimated i spent about $3400 on games, and about another $100 on a folding table and kallax shelves. this doesn’t include two kickstarters i’ve currently backed and am awaiting. the bulk of my expense come from backing a couple of expensive all-in kickstarters (xia, dinosaur island, aeon end, batman gotham city chronicles, 7th continent).. and of course kdm and it’s wave 1 expansion also added up, but i wa able to back these before they were full price. barring these, the rest of my collection ($1300) were usually purchased when game were marked a “all time lows” on ccc, clearance sales, b2g1 deals, and a couple of bn $2 clearance deals. i think the only game i paid full price for (nonkickstarter) wa catan and some of it expansions.. my first introduction into tabletop games. that being said, if you had to estimate- how much have you dropped on your collection? do you feel a if the entertainment had wa worth the cost? if i had to guess, i’ve probably had 50 game night over the past 5 years.. so $70/night? never mind that i have about 15 unplayed games, 20+ unplayed expansions, and several game played once! nevertheless, you could do a lot worse for a night out. edit: look like we got a huge bell curve of number here! here’s a tool that will estimate your bgg value (based on market prices, and doesn’t take into consideration kickstarter version and exclusives.) it doesn’t equal what you actually paid tho.. i paid le than my collection is worth."

605,t3_c9l5wd,developer diary for werewolf vs. vampire,8,"after 2 year of working on my board game ""werewolf vs. vampire"", i would like to offer to write a developer diary for the game. it's about all the small step after the offer - to the finished product including shipping. my question is, are you interested? leave me a comment. #x200b; i started to keep the diary on facebook and so i already listed the first 5 day here. if you like this, i would post more diary entry here once a week. #x200b; a previous knowledge is still important that i had a campaign on kickstarter, which i had to stop. why, you can read here: ## day 1 finally i agreed with a developing company on the production settings. they are going to send me template for the different items. ## day 2 i have received the following question: why did you cancel the last kickstarter campaign? **the short answer** 3d mini **detail answer** in the first campaign, a lot of people asked about my minis. so, in order to do everything right in the second campaign, i offered minis. i had to stop the last kickstarter campaign because only 3 people wanted them. therefore, i wa in a dilemma. #x200b; if i get 2 mini produced, there is a one-time amount of about 2,300 euros. even if everyone buy miniature this cost about 10 euro on kickstarter (5€ + kickstarter cost + financial institution + returns). #x200b; but for 10 euro apparently only 3 people were willed to buy these. so i would not only have to cover for the cost for 300 games, but also the cost for 497 minis. ## day 3 i told you that on kickstarter not all supporter wanted miniature for 10 euro. at the same time, it wa not possible for me to keep this offer for 3 bidders. #x200b; but now to the solution for the miniature problem. since the campaign a lot of time ha gone by and i have been looking a lot for 3d miniature solutions. for a long time, i didn't find anything that met my quality standards. a few approaches: \- smallest production quantity: the price per miniature is then 7.50€ so even more money and even fewer supporter who want to have the product then. \- diy 3d printing (filament): absolutely not. apart from the fact that the people, who try to get good result of 3d printing spend a little more time on this task - the result is not sufficient for me. of course, you can get better results, but only by using sandpaper and a lot of time. #x200b; then by chance i became aware of another printing process. #x200b; from time to time i enter search term at different platform and on a wonderful wednesday evening this wa '3d printing' on kickstarter. the result wa a printing process that i hadn't really followed until then, a the printer were at 2,300 euros. now the price wa below 300 euros. so i sent a mail to the 3d nerd i trust and asked if that could be good and promptly received the answer ""no, they start at over 2k euros"". after i had sent the link, the statement changed into: ""wow, that sound pretty good."" #x200b; so, i supported the printer. but everyone who is involved with kickstarter also know that many project in the field of technology failed. #x200b; but i wanted to know more about it and have really been involved with the printing process in detail. and look at that, on amazon there wa an almost equivalent printer with a 20 euro discount and one material for free. another 2 day later i ordered the printer. #x200b; what should i say: \- easy to use \- real fun \- super result (professional) #x200b; i then took the first result with me to my 3d friend and because of the miniature i printed out with them, another printer wa sold immediately. #x200b; the printout so far look so good that i am convinced that i can produce small quantity at at least the same price. #x200b; that way i won't run into the same trap again for the next campaign and can even offer a little highlight. but that won't be revealed yet. ## day 4 today i would like to say something about the decision on the production quantity. #x200b; a large part of the decision wa taken from me: #x200b; when you produce a game, there's always a minimum quantity that you have to buy. for most of the manufacturer i wrote to, this is 500. others want to sell at least 1500 pieces. #x200b; i've read in many forum that at the end of a kickstarter campaign you can sell the same amount through other distribution channels. that should then include amazon, ebay, dealers, game event and this should also be the end of sales. #x200b; in my first campaign, i had oriented myself to other title and wanted to recoup production cost a much a possible. therefore, i had specified 8,000€ a target mark. that would have been about 365 supporters. but i landed at 80 (some jumped off towards the end). with the improved second campaign i had to break off with almost 60 supporters. i think i could have got 120 supporter here. #x200b; so, let's stay with 120 supporters. if i could sell that much again in post-sale, i should make 240 pieces. #x200b; the temptation to produce more is huge, because the different production quantity don't cost so much at the end of the day. #x200b; when i compared the offers, the following came out. 500 piece á 15€ - 7.500€ 1.500 pc á 7€ - 10.500€ each #x200b; but since i would already have 260 game on stock at the moment, i don't have to spend 3.000€ to fill the stock completely with them. #x200b; i even found a company that would have produced 260 game for me. now guess what it would have cost: right - 7.500 euro. ## day 5 today i would like to talk about the different offer i got for 10-sided dice. there are always surprising differences, which can be clarified, but are by no mean obvious. this statement can be used almost 1:1 for all other components. for 500 pieces: id..each…development cost a....0.18…………. € 260 € b....0.13…………...€ 0 € c....0.54…………...€ 0 € that look very clearly like offer b. only by explicit asking i found this (after several requests😊). what doe development cost mean in dice production? for dice ""templates"" have to be made. these are good for 5,000 dice. a new tepmlate must be made, even if only the color are minimally different. and why do some of them manage without development costs? they don't. offer b is only based on the assumption that the manufacturer still ha such similar dice in stock (someone else had perhaps only taken 500 of the 5,000 and so dice are left). but since i want to have a certain color combination, a template ha to be made. but why doe offer c have no development costs? that is simply math: offer a) 500 pcs. x 0.18 € + 260 € = 350€ offer c) 500 pcs. x 0.70 € + 000 € = 350 € offer c ha therefore simply passed on the development cost to each individual die. #x200b;

614,t3_c96d4j,on susd and rule,327,"let me be a jerk for a moment and criticize one of my most beloved game reviewers, susd. they were the one that re-ignited my passion for board game with their fantastic review of azul (paul!). they are always entertaining and often include fascinating segment in their reviews, like that time they discussed orientalism and the place of woman (that is, none) in istanbul. their recent podcast featuring the book ""top 10 game you can play in your head, by yourself"" wa the best and most original gaming content i've heard in a long while. even my reddit name is an homage to one of their reviews. that said, something about them ha been nagging me for some time and i just had to voice it out. it probably bug me more because i like them so much. they so often get the rule of their game wrong. it occurs so often that i can't help but notice it. it happened for gugong recently: they said game wa good but a bit underwhelming, and a commenter on their site wrote ""you were using the double servant wrong"", to which quinns replied "" i checked the rule on this *three time*s and still apparently got it wrong?"". of course it make you wonder: would they have liked the game better if they played it right? probably. maybe? and now almost 100k viewer saw the ""underwhelmed"" video review, and in the currently saturated game market, this mean most of those people are probably going to pas on the game. it happened with their playthrough of gloomhaven. a youtube commenter wrote a list of 10 (!) rule error they made in the video. but didn't matt spend hour and hour creating a wonderfully produced 35 minute review of the game about a year before? did he do all the playtesting, script writing, video shooting and editing, the review wa seen by 675k people... and he had the rule wrong all along? did he just forget them? this happens with very simple game too. have a look at their gin rummy video, even then quinns make lot of rule mistakes. which are corrected in text overlays, but then they appear so often that it becomes hard to follow. and a an internet jerk who comfortably enjoys your free content and hard labour, let me ask a very naive question: for a video where the whole point is to teach the game, for a simple game that you just taught in 5 minute not counting a bit of banter... why not just reshoot the whole thing on the spot and make it right? what's the point of a rule video where the rule are wrong? it happened again with the very simple press-your-luck game ""that’s not lemonade"" (18 card and a few cups) they described a being not very good in their podcast. in the next one they noted the designer had contacted them saying that they had missed a central rule of the game, which made it way le dumb than they had presented it. how could they still get such a simple game wrong, especially when they feature it on their podcast? and then i remembered them saying how they played skull wrong for a long time at first, with people bidding free-for-all instead of in order. which luckily for this other game publisher made the game more fun for them this time. but when you cannot grasp the rule of a game like skull, of course you're going to make mistake with gugong and gloomhaven. granted, most of these games, they acknowledged the error on their website or in a follow-up podcast. and of course it is hard to get rule right when you have to try so many in a week. error happen of course, it's fine. but then in this case it look like it's becoming systematic. i can't help but get annoyed, because those recurring mistake make me doubt the value of all their other very entertaining reviews. especially for game with complex rule like lisboa and root, and for game they say they did not enjoy. the writing is top-notch, the video production stellar... but if i can't trust the review is it worth it? many of my friend who play occasionaly don't care much about rules. when they open their brand new game, they skim the rule to get to play a fast a possible. and who cares, right? isn't the goal to have fun? they are surprised when they play the same game with me and the rule are way different than they remember. susd ha also been focused from the start on having fun with your friends, and that is for the best. but a game reviewer with hundred of thousand of viewers, shouldn't they be held to a higher standard? am i the only one noticing or caring about this?"

(also my collection is severely lacking lotr games.) cracked it open and it wa indeed a complete game, not even a chit out place. played a few time and now..... i love it!!! planning on buying expansion if you have any suggestions. ;) i don't know what's changed but it certainly isn't the game. just curious if anyone else ha had a similar experience with a game in their collection. it doesn't have to be a dramatic a re-purchasing a game maybe you've bought something you weren't in love with and have since found a place in your heart (and collection) for it just wanna read some stories. thanks for reading!!!"

630,t3_c9w4jv,playing charterstone without permanently modifying it?,0,"hello everyone, i recently picked up a copy of charterstone during a sale, but i'm struggling with the legacy aspect: i admit to being very reluctant to the idea of permanently altering or even destroying game components. the main issue is that now that i've bought it, i want to play all 12 game of it to get the full experience. however, i don't know if that's going to happen since i don't have a group of dedicated hardcore boardgamers that are guaranteed to play it until the end of the campaign, so i'm afraid some player will drop out for various reasons, leaving me with an unusable half-played game. #x200b; is there anyone out there who ha managed to improvise a reusable version? for example, creating cardboard tile for the sticker or tracking where everything is on the board to facilitate setting it up again on the next game. thoughts?"

648,t3_ca0amm,my issue with star wars: rebellion,16,"i've played star war rebellion 10-15 time now, and i've enjoyed each and every game. the issue is, i'm beginning to enjoy it le and le because of a flaw in the game. to me, combat seems like complete tedium at this point. the first few game it wa so much fun to chuck dice and see all the tactic cards, playing out epic climactic battles. at this point for me, the theme is beginning to fade, and the mechanic are more apparent to me now. combat just seems... repetitive? it's a chore at this point. i play twilight imperium, and in that game, the space combat ha to be won first, then the ground combat. one of my many issue with rebellion combat system is that i only have to bring a single assault carrier an some strong ground troop into a system if i want to take the planet. sure, my assault carrier will be obliterated, but my troop will get on the ground safely. in this way, it make me feel like amassing space troop (especially a the empire, who will always have the superior number of troops), is pointless. i'll beat the rebel pretty easily because i make troop so much easier a i start with more systems. next, the tactic cards. this is a complete mess to me. having to shuffle and deal little deck every single time i want to start a new combat is so boring. yes, it make certain leader stronger in combat than others (which i appreciate), but there isn't much variety, and it feel like a cheap move so that the same dice can be used on skill check and combat. i have sort of burned out on the combat in this game, especially playing war game like root and sekigahara (which are not the same genre a rebellion, but root ha a 5 second combat system, and sekigahara is so strategic in combat). what have other fan of this game done to keep combat exciting? doe the expansion fix it? what should i do differently, if anything? thanks in advance for the responses."
649,t3_c9tlp0,a a new player; how do you decide what game to purchase?,99,"a a new player to the board game scene, looking up game to play in a vast variety of genre and the amount that are available is quite daunting. game played in the past are the general family games; monopoly, scrabble and payday type but year ago dabbled in talisman a a young teen and loved it but went back to video games. over the year interest in video game just become le and le but recently the general family game have been hitting the dining table but wanting a new challenge. income is good but not to a point where it like oh this game look awesome but a little pricey but order it, it not that great, put it on the shelf, let look for another. so when you started out, how did you used to narrow down which game to buy? after purchasing a few game did you make tweak to how you decided, what were they and how do you now? also another factor in purchasing a game, is backing a game, either through kickstarter. maybe wrong but seems a lot of table top game get kickstarters and stay a only kickstarter games. should a new player in table top game even be looking at backing games? do you use the same process you use to determine if you should back it a if you were purchasing a retail game? or do you even bother and hope a game on kickstarter becomes available after it campaign. like i have seen 7th continent on many top 10 list and is only a kickstarter game, is that a risk you take?"

(2) is the game compatible with phone or are tablet needed? (3) if it is compatible with phones, is it manageable given the small screen real estate some phone have? (4) is there an add-friend system where you and your friend can set up private matches? or is this game pass-and-play multiplayer only? (5) (probably the most important question) - if there is an add-friend and set up private match options, are there push notification to tell you when it's your turn and if so, is it reliable? thanks. any help would be greatly appreciated."

(you could also say the star die face in king of ny fit the bill since they are contexualized only by the superstar card, but that’s, uh, dicey.) doe this make sense? doe the terminology exist? any help is appreciated. thanks!"

673,t3_cadf1l,hero of land air and sea question,0,"after the long setup, understanding the rule and playing with 4 people, we all ended up sitting on our own island getting resource and building an army. then, one person attack an opponent with hardly anyone in her capital and start endgame and win easily. we spent over an bour to build army without even having incentive to attack anyone. i didnt find any reason to build an air or sea vessel when you can just walk across the dotted line over the sea to someone island. i felt like this game wa just explore.... with no expansion or real incentive to attack or take over someone island. air and sea vessel didnt seem important at all. we didnt play wrong based on the rule but after all the work it just puttered out and didnt have any combat besides the one player attacking and defeating the other. is there any reason to attack early or use vehicles? cant you just turtle up and recruit people until the game ends? needing some assistance because this wa super underwhelming. i expeceted a game of exploration mixed with a combat focus similar to kemet but it didnt happen. there no point in fighting in a game that aplears to be about fighting. btw we bought twilight imperium 4 also but havent played yet."

689,t3_c9t5xd,dominion lovers....great randomized,236,"a little background. been gaming for 5 year now. dominion wa one of the first game i bought. introduced me to deck building. over those 5 year my taste swayed “heavily” into heavy euro game like vinhos, arkwright, and 18xx. but my love for dominion never faded. it’s simplistic approach made it a great filler game. a great game to start a game night. but one of the thing that always hampered some of my enjoyment wa choosing a selection of cards. enter this is a great tool for my fellow dominion enthusiasts. just plug in your sets, the type of configuration, and boom, you’ve got your game. enjoy."

727,t3_cagsle,the best gaming experience of my life.,58,"my wife recently surprised me with a copy of twilight imperium forth edition. the price tag and the game length are what held me back, but my wife bought it for me anyways. tonight we played our first game, a 4 player game. we played for 13 hour including set up, learning, and eating breaks. we had to end early though, and finished with my wife and i tied at 8 points, but one of u would have won next round. i can say without hesitation or doubt, this wa the greatest gaming experience i have ever had. everything about this game wa firing on all cylinders, it's worth every penny. it will outshine all your other boardgames, so buy it now and save yourself some money, or buy it later after you've bought other game you won't play after twilight imperium. player interaction is where twilight imperium out shine other games. you are forced to expand if you want to gain victory point and grow your army. a the board get crowded, and army get larger, simply moveing one space over, or building a new fleet can generate debate and discussion. also, after each round you cast vote for or against new rules, or elect player or planet to recieve good or bad conditions. this voting creates heated debate and bartering. combat is very exciting, and your success is balanced between luck and strategy. have you upgraded your ship enough before hand? do you have secret action card to destroy your opponent fleet, or nullify their attacks? you decide which ship of yours get destroyed in combat, which is where strategy come in. after the battle in outer space is complete, the next step is invading the planet below. bombardment from ships, space cannons, and infantry all play a part in this phase. the lore, and 17 playable races, all make for an immersive experience. reading the introduction pull you in to make you feel like your really part of this galactic battle. and reading your race lore make you feel connected in some way. i wish i made the plunge earlier, because this game is it. it trump all other war/strategy game imo. maybe game like scythe and rising don't take a long to play, but it's so worth it to invest the time and money into twilight imperium instead. you will not be disappointed."

(sidenote: it took me 15 play of **carcassonne** 1v1 against him to finally beat him.) this is somewhat beside the main point, but in those first 10 play or whatever, he probably won at least half. the remaining half wa split up among another 2 or 3 friends. that left me with 0 win in over 10 plays, and hell, i owned the game. i own most of the game we play. but on a glorious night last week, i played citadel with him and another friend (one of the others who ha actually won before), and while the start looked a little bit rocky, i *finally*, for the first time ever, beat my friend at citadels. i can now die happy."

751,t3_catw3k,game mechanic that allow the number of player to increase over time,21,"in typical games, n player start the game and n – x player are still playing at the time the game ends. in chess and checker n = 2 and x = 0. both player are involved until the game is complete. in other games, x 0, and one or more player will exit the game before the game is completed. monopoly, risk, diplomacy, and many other game are exemplar of this type. the rise of cooperative game mean that there are quite a few option for gamers who don’t want any player eliminated before the game is complete. the thing is, however, that a) some gamers some of the time want to play game in which one or more player are eliminated before the game end and b) there is a social downside to those type of games: being eliminated early mean a player ha nothing to do while the rest of the group continue to play. this can be particularly unpleasant if a person is eliminated several hour before the game ends. most people join a game group to play games, not to simply watch others play games. so what i am wondering, ha anyone created a card or board game in which 1 or 2 player start the game, and the game allows additional player to continually join over time? the type of game i envision might start with one or two players, and then additional player could enter at any time mid-game, and remain until the end. such a game would be particularly useful in a situation in which a bunch of friend start game a, in which player are eliminated one after the other (e.g. diplomacy). in this situation, a each gamer is eliminated from game a, s/he could join game b. this allows every person (even those eliminated from game a) to be an active player for an entire evening of gaming. there is one other situation that a game that support an increasing number of player might address: the situation in which you know that several member of your group will arrive on time, but several others will show up late. i should say that i am super new to gaming in general (and this sub in particular), so my apology if this question ha been addressed before, or if there is a super well-known example of a game that allows gamers to continually join the action."
752,t3_cau406,a case for charterstone,23,"disclaimer: i'm not super involved in the meta of this sub, so sorry if this break a rule for posting content that i'm not aware of. just let me know. i heard a lot of mixed review on this sub about charterstone before i bought it. most of them were either negative or *bleh*. i've now played 10 of 12 sessions, and wanted to talk about why i think it is a super unique experience. one fo the thing i love about game is the excitement of a playing a new one. i think a lot of people share this: we play many game because we love the puzzle, and a new game is a new puzzle to solve. charterstone, by unlocking new spot on the board locations, workers, and development cards, make a new puzzle everytime you play. on top of this, the guidepost provide a new goal (and often a game altering, one-time special rule) which change the puzzle regardless of the change on the board. i know there are plenty of game that change the subset of card we play with or the win conditions, offering ""infinite"" replayability. however, even though it is hard to explain why, charterstone feel different. maybe that's because charterstone is always moving forward, subtracting and adding, insted of recombining the same mechanics. to put it abstractly, charterstone's progress feel linear, while other game with a constantly-changing puzzle feel circular. i also know that other legacy game might offer something similar, but it seems that charterstone's focus on being a euro-game first put the puzzle at the forefront, while most other legacy game to-date are plot-driven. i really hope there are other eurolegacy game in development, even though ti seems like the legacy craze ha died down a bit. this game isn't perfect of course, and i think this is it biggest flaw: i think it would be pretty hard to find 6 people in the same group who all loved this game, and i also can't imagine playing it without 6 people (there are rule for automated player that just wouldn't be the same). in my family 2 people love it, 2 like it, and 2 can't wait for it to be over. the other biggest flaw is that in term of scoring point and winning, i think the scoring incentivizes you to find a simple boring engine and hold on to it for dear life, instead of welcoming the change and trying new strategies. that's why my wife wa really bored with the game, despite winning half of the rounds. i got charterstone for 29.99 around october last year. when it get down to that price, i highly recommend picking up a copy if you at all think you'd be interested. a much a i enjoyed it, i would've been happy paying retail price for it ($70/12 session = $8ish per night, divided by 6 people = $1.50 per person per night)."

755,t3_cazg1z,ha trickerion replaced pret-a-porter?,3,"i wa enthusiastic about new edition of pret-a-porter coming to kickstarter that i didn't play year ago when it wa available. but new art looked beautiful and with kickstarter launching, i looked more into it. and now that i've watched video and rules, including old video by rahdo and tom vasel, i can't get over the fact that pret-a-porter is something that trickerion ha (unintentionally i suppose) already done better? in trickerion you gather resources, hire special worker and prepare trick for a show that happens few time every game and both have strong worker placement elements. but in trickerion everything seems more dynamic, your worker have plenty of more layer both on your board and on the table, worker placement board ha a better interactive arc and resource cost over what is valuable at any point of time in the game and the magic show puzzle (where multiple magician can participate in the same show) is more climactic. also the trick are more interesting to prepare for and combine and compete over. so is trickerion a heavier pret-a-porter? or doe pret-a-porter do something better than trickerion does? in this era of one-in-one-out it's hard to justify a more mainstream version of trickerion - even though art of pret-a-porter is very unique."

765,t3_cavene,the overshrinking of game box,6,"how is it that game designer (i'm particularly looking at you, kickstarter games) can't figure out that a lot of people like to sleeve their card and adjust their box size accordingly. the size of the box i'm finding with modern game make no sense. they're slightly bigger than they need to be for simply holding what come in them, but they're not big enough to hold sleeved cards? i understand that a lot of these campaign make minimal (or no) profit, and they're trying to keep shipping cost down a much a they are trying to eliminate wasted box space, but game like crypt, unbroken, and bargain quest are all going to be sitting on my shelf with the lid awkwardly lifted an inch high. it seems like a tiny bit more planning could go into this stuff. i know that unbroken even changed the size of some of the card to fit in regular sleeves, because so many people wanted to sleeve it. doe this bother anyone else? are there any game designer out there who can explain or defend why this is the case? edit: wow, this got a lot of great responses. after reading all y'all's comments, i should clarify a couple things: 1. for the purpose of this thread, i wa just talking about overall box size, not the inserts. i'm pretty content to replace, adjust, or throw out my insert now; a a couple of you pointed out, most are only there for shipping purposes. it's when stuff still doesn't fit that it start to bother me. 2. i do sleeve card that some of you have pointed out could go unsleeved - i like the feel of handling sleeved card more, and i like protecting even non-shuffled, non-frequently-handled card from accidental damage. #x200b; also, it seems like the discussion boil down to a few points: #x200b; 1. it look like sleeving (at least complete sleeving) is le common that i assumed it to be. maybe this isn't something that is on players' or designers' mind a much. 2. someone mentioned that this is not a choice made by the designer, but by the publisher. that doesn't change my overall argument, but it definitely change where i should have been directing it - thank you for clarifying this for me. 3. it sound like cost and lack of necessity are the main force at play. i suppose that's understandable, but i wish it would at least be a stretch goal on some project or something... i would rather have slightly bigger box size than a special uv printed cover. designer and publisher already try to cater to what player want - maybe there just isn't enough player interest in this yet for it to be important."

793,t3_capmnx,blood on the clocktower review,138,"after planning for a couple weeks, my friend and i finally played a print-and-play version of blood on the clocktower (botc) that i had put together. given the hullabaloo about the susd review earlier this year, i figured i'd pitch in with my take on the game. a bit of background: my friend and i have played social deduction games, but it is definitely not our favorite genre by any means. we used to play the resistance and one night ultimate werewolf somewhat regularly, but those game fell out of fashion. in particular, we soured on the resistance because there simply wasn’t enough actual information in the game to make it ‘interesting’. we now mostly play medium-ish games, some favorite being ginkopolis, inis, not alone, scythe, terraforming mars, and spirit island. i mostly wanted to try botc due to the susd review – the idea of having that wonderful big group experience while still having logical, tactical deduction instead of shouting match sounded wonderful. most people had played mafia or werewolf before, so explaining the rule wa fairly simple. on the first game, the good character cautiously shared information, while the evil player generally kept quiet and offered tentative alibis. it wa only when the supposed monk realized that they were drunk did everyone go ‘wait, what?’ and the game started to shine. from there, the lie and deception started to flow much more naturally. we played another game right after with me storytelling, and another game with a new storyteller right after that. the new storyteller wa able to pick up the role without too much effort, and we had a brilliant game of second guessing ourselves with a baron in play. after the initial 3 plays, we then played the game 5 time with almost the same group the next day. everyone got much more comfortable with the different role and at bluffing, although one person did get slightly flustered at being the imp three time in a row. but it wa the last game that truly sold it for our group. the demon wa about to be killed through a smart deception from the ravenkeeper, but the spy successfully planted the idea that a poisoner could be about. her word caused the good team to frantically analyze any possibility of their previous assumption being wrong. we wavered over which outsider wa in play for 10 minutes. the supposed recluse almost burst a blood vessel after we spent so much time considering if there wa a drunk. it finally ended when we finally decided on killing the demon, the good team collapsing in a group hug when the storyteller announced that good had triumphed. we spent the next 30 minute exhilarated and exhausted, going over all the craziness that had happened. it wa the kind of high that any player of a social deduction game dream of. it’s a bit hard to explain what feel different between botc and it older cousins, but i think the biggest change is the lack of player elimination. everyone can be involved for the whole game, and everyone *wants* to be involved for the whole game because they have their own unique role. this also mean that the whole group is wrapped up in the dramatic tension at the end of the game – no one except the storyteller know exactly what is going on. the game length varied a bit, but in general they were about 30 minute all included with 7 players. the quick game length wa definitely a plus overall, since most people got to experience different part of the game with their different roles. overall, this is definitely my #1 social deduction game now. i loved the way i wa not only always questioning other players, but also myself. whenever i had a hunch about another player lying, i could reason out how that hunch could affect the given scenario. victory and loss both felt very earned. i can’t wait to make printout of the ‘bad moon rising’ and ‘violets and sects’ modules, and i highly recommend anyone on the fence to print out a copy, grab a group, and try it for yourself. i’ll end by saying that i have never backed a kickstarter game before – and i hope to never do so again – but this is one game i really want to share with everyone i know and play it more."
794,t3_cazjn5,help with designing a one-shot mafia game?,8,"in a chinese entertainment show called keep running, there wa a variant mafia game with 10 people, where the mafia had to rip off a name-tag off the town people's back in order to kill them. nobody knew what role the others were (even mafia didn't know who mafia were). the location wa an empty old town, with clue interspersed throughout the area a to who the mafia were. the only way the town could kill mafia wa by finding card throughout the town on which they could write names, after then that person would instantly die. (of course, mafia could use these card too) additionally, there wa a shrine any number of people could walk into (3 in the ep), it would tell you if there wa a majority of mafia in the shrine or not (green/red light). this shrine wa the starting point of the game and popped up two more time - in the middle, and to finish the game. the catch wa that the player began the game with an intro along the line of ""our elder died, but at least the three didn't manage to do anything else"" which made the player believe there were only 3 mafia, but it wa actually a misleading statement nobody considered - there were actually only 3 town ; and it wa chaos when people immediately betrayed their mafia status but ended up killing their own team off. #x200b; sorry if the explanation wa too long, but i wanted to convert this into a smaller scale variant to play with friend in a house setting - either by just adding rule to the normal game (w/ poker cards) sitting in a circle, or maybe something more exciting with clue around the house. problem is i can't really think about how mafia killing should work? thanks for any help in advance!

810,t3_cbcbj4,extending two room and a boom with resistance power cards?,5,"just played a round of two room and a boom, and while i liked it a a party activity, imo it paled in strategy and deduction comparison to a game like resistance. i felt the difference mainly came down to: * strong symmetry - blue and red equally want to hide their role to the other team and share with their own. compare to resistance where the team are unequal and one side must play very differently. * even trade - for the most part you are sharing equal info with someone - it's a good move if they are on your side and it's a net-neutral move if they're not. so there isn't a strategic incentive to make move (aside from speeding the game along) * randomness and meta-gaming. it seems like a clear goal to get control and get president and bomber in your room for the second-to-last round. but it felt like any configuration with president and bomber separated is just 50/50 or relying on meta-gaming. even if you have perfect information about all roles, you're just facing off with meta-strategies and hoping that the other room doe not make a mirror move to ruin your plan. ha anyone come up with home brew way to improve the red v blue strategy? i thought more asymmetry and forced information reveals could be beneficial for the game, for example reusing resistance power card or treating stuff like the enforcer a an ability card to be used once per round. in this way there are more ""obvious"" move that speed the game along, while providing semi-public information for player to base their decision around."

839,t3_cb2s9i,"cooperative deck builder - the good, the bad, and the ugly",689,"most of my board game time in the past 10 year ha been 2-player with my wife. once we were introduced to pandemic, co-op game have been our bread and butter. we'll mix in the occasional game of terraforming mar or concordia, but co-op game seem to be the ideal game for many couple - and we fit that mold. we've had a lot of enjoyment lately playing co-op deck builder in particular, so i thought i'd share what we've learned so far. i'll talk about these game roughly from least to most favorite. there are a couple of game in this list that might not fit the definition exactly, but this is my post, so i'll do what i want. first up is **shadowrun: crossfire** (10 plays). this game ha the structure of a great deck builder, but fails in the execution. i really liked the theme - the mix of futuristic tech and magic wa very cool (i understand there is a shadowrun universe, but i know nothing about it). the game had some neat little element - a campaign like structure where you can earn perk to make your character stronger, which allows you to attempt harder missions. it's failing were critical for us, however. lot of co-op game are swingy because of card draw, but s:c pretty much take the cake. you can have insta-lose right away due to bad card draw, or you can feel good about yourself and then get massacred in one turn. i like my co-op hard, but reasonably so - i don't want to have to grind out the same mission over and over to gain perks. it's a board game, not a video game. *you might like this if*: you like losing a lot, you love the shadowrun universe, insta-lose is your friend. **harry potter: hogwarts battle** (20 plays) is an interesting one. this game is the best bad game i've every played. a a family of harry potter fanatics, buying this game wa a no-brainer, but my expectation were low. once we got into it, we found numerous thing that we loved, and just a many that we hated. essentially, it is a great game that is fundamentally broken. you can read [my specific thought here]() right now). i understand that there's a 2nd edition with expansion and more content, but the price tag seems high to me. i'm expecting to get 20+ play out of it and then move it in a trade. i don't see it a a long term game without more content. *you might like this if*: you want to play around with an interesting shared deck mechanic, you like trying out fun new game that won't take over your life well, speaking of taking over your life, let's talk about **legendary: marvel** (10 plays). i'm just going to lump all the flavor of legendary together and call them legendary: marvel. there is a huge amount of content in the legendary game universe, so you can explore it a deeply a you wish. essentially every game you have a starting hand, there is a random market of cards, there are villains, and there's a big bad to fight. every fight is slightly different due to the various mechanic brought to the table by your setup. every game i've played of this ha been enjoyable but not spectacular. in general it's a well tuned system that feel just a bit too sterile to me. my friend owns lot of content for this game, and we always joke that playing legendary is 3 game in 1. game 1: assemble the cards, game 2: play the game, game 3: sort all the card and put everything away again. *you might like this if*: you love the ip, you have an organization fetish now, before you yell at me that **sentinels of the multiverse** (12 plays) isn't a deck builder, let me just say this: you're correct. however, it feel so much like these other game that i feel it is legal to include this in the list. if you are looking for a co-op deck builder to play, sotm might be the game you love. sentinel ha a few amazing thing going for it, and one big downside. the positive first: awesome theme - just a wonderful comic book world that you get to play in. great deck - instead of building a deck a you go, each hero ha their own pre-constructed deck. and boy doe each deck play differently. you get a real sense of how each hero is a different character by what they can do with their cards. super quick to set up - grab hero decks, bad guy deck, environment deck, and your tokens. bam! ready to play. did i say ""tokens""? ah, yes, to the negative - saying that sentinel is a bit fiddly is like saying campaign for north africa run a bit long. i'm getting ready to attack and i have a +1 damage token on my guy, and there's another +1 damage token ... is that for me, or only when attacking the environment? wait, why is that +1 damage taken token there? did the card that brought that into play get discarded or not? what type of damage did he do? am i immune to fire or not? it's not insurmountable, and it definitely get easier with multiple plays, but managing the token and health is a barrier to enjoying the game. if that sound frustrating, don't even try this game. but if you can get over that hurdle, sentinel offer some truly great experience with very fun, thematic cards. *you might like this if*: you like superheroes, cool combos, and are fine with fiddly mechanic so, you thought i wa cheating with sentinels? how about this - my next game is **orleans: invasion** (20 plays), a game that doesn't even have cards! before you string me up by my meeples, hear me out: orleans is a bag builder, and a bag builder is simply a modified deck builder. i'm including it because i find this game definitely scratch some of the same itch of the other game on this list. you're working together, building up an engine, trying to beat the big bad. in order to play the cooperative version of orleans, you need the base game plus the invasion expansion. on the one hand, that's a relatively big investment; on the other hand, you also have the exceptional base game of orleans to play. the invasion expansion doe a masterful job of turning a purely competitive game into a cooperative experience. each player get their own role which requires them to achieve different goal along with the group goals. the role change every game, and the random event change, so the puzzle is different every time. difficulty can easily be scaled up or down. we have had numerous game that came down to the last turn, which is exactly what i want in a co-op. *you might like this if*: you like bag building, you like orleans i'm saving the best for last, so it's time for **aeon's end** (150+ plays). i won't deny that i'm a fanboy. aeon's end ha marched all the way up to be my #1 favorite game of all time. i own all content, and backed the latest kickstarter. so at least you know where i'm coming from here. in aeon's end, you play mages who are trying to defend gravehold from an attacking nemesis. the primary strength of ae is the incredible variability you get with the different type of mages, nemeses, and market cards. every game feel unique and different - a mage that might work well against one nemesis could fall flat against a different one. my wife and i like to do a completely randomized setup, and then tweak it if we end up in a battle we can't win. mechanically, aeon's end is a finely tuned machine. the vast majority of the game we've played have been entertaining and close. you feel like you're getting stronger, which is good because you know the minion get stronger a well. the nemesis deck is built in tiers. each nemesis ha their own unique cards, and those are mixed in with a random collection of basic cards. these are stacked with the easiest tier on top. the criticism could be: ""it take longer to set up."" however, i will take a slightly longer setup time that give me a better overall experience instead of the insta-lose game you can have with hp:hb or shadowrun. and you are rarely put in a no-win situation. even game where we lose in the mid-game are winnable with a strategy change. most of the time we just reset the game and give it another go. and, aeon's end is simply cool. you have to open breach to create more space to play more spells. you choose between gems, relics, and spell to buy to get the perfect deck. you can also charge up the special ability that only your mage has. the pace, flow, and feel of the game just sing for me. (important note: i vastly prefer ae at 2p over 3 or 4. i just feel you get more powerful and can do more cool thing at the lower player count.) finally, there are two important mechanic to mention. 1. a deck builder with no shuffling. it's a cool thing, because this game expects you to pack your discard pile to get powerful combos. it add interesting decision on when to buy a card, or when to hold card in your hand for the next turn. 2. variable turn order. at 2p, everybody (each mage and the nemesis) get 2 turn order cards. those 6 card are shuffled and flipped to determine who go when. it make a procedural game more dynamic. this brings up another common complaint of ae: ""you can win or lose depending on how the turn order deck wa shuffled!"" often time that's true, but i love it - and if you end up losing, there wa probably something better you could have done earlier to put yourself in a better position. so there we go. way too much text about co-op deckbuilders. i'd love to hear if anybody ha other game they've played and would recommend. i've got a couple on my want in trade list, so hopefully they'll make it to my table at some point."

842,t3_cbk3py,mansion of madness house rule,5,"so i've been playing mansion of madness on and off with 2 other friends, and routinely we find the game is extremely difficult or ponderous to play. before we've explored half the map, scenario tend to end, or enemy tend to pwn us. 20 attempt later, we still can't finish the escape from innsmouth. i had an idea for a rule to fix this where: #x200b; investigator can move 1 extra space a a free action. this cannot be done if: the player us two move action that turn. the player cannot use this move if an enemy monster is in line of sight or will be in line of sight during the player's turn. #x200b; it's an idea that the player are in a sort of ""exploring"" mode, and moving a great deal more carefree. however if a predator is close by, they need to be cautious, and watch their footing. will this break the game?"

846,t3_cbwrdc,"if you’re looking for a great solo or group cooperative game, i can not recommend the 7th continent enough.",3,"so i wa fortunate enough to catch this game during it second kickstarter run and went all in for the expansion and everything. and i’m so glad i did. i have recently found the time to dedicate to this game properly and have been making my way through the *curse scenarios.* it ha been an absolute blast of an experience and i can’t wait to play more. this game is kind of a slow burn. it’s not face paced, intense action or combat. it is interactive story telling reminiscent of when i read choose your own adventure book a a kid, which is exactly what they were going for. the exploration in this game is so much fun. every time i get to a new tile, there’s so much i can do. and each choice usually is followed by another either/or decision that can have beneficial or damning consequences. i can craft equipment to help me along, but doing so might eventually cost me unless i’m being smart about how i use my resources. each gamble i take on following a new path could ultimately leave me sick, hurt, or worse, dead. but the payoff is worth it when i’m rewarded with life-saving medicine, or a weapon to combat danger, or that ever important flame to keep hope alive. the game just tell the narrative so well with such little information presented on the board. each section of terrain usually ha a small piece of story attached to it, with each action also furthering the storyline a your progress. plus, there’s so many different expansion now that this will have me entertained for a long time trying to get through each one. granted, i’m sure there will be some slight overlap in card because after all, there is a finite number in the game of certain options, however the way it is crafted, i doubt this will matter much a the way in which the situation present will be completely different from any time it ha presented before due to circumstance, progression, and game state. the only downside i could see is replay ability eventually running out or growing slightly stale. the first play through everything is new and there’s so many option to explore, you can’t possibly hope to hit all of them. even if you decide to play through the same story a second and third time i could see it playing out differently because of card mechanic and choices. eventually, however, it will exhaust itself to where you know all the result and by that point, i will have gotten my money’s worth several time over and i’ll only be too happy to part with the game to let someone else enjoy it for the first time. group play is great, but it can get a little mucked up because there isn’t really a turn order dynamic and so quarterback or dominant player can often time take over or steamroll decisions, but if you have a solid play group that can work together, the game is a blast to explore with a group. however, solo it definitely shines. it’s one of those game in my collection where when i have a spare hour or two, i can break it out and just enjoy working through the story and seeing where it take me. the *save* mechanic that the game incorporates for keeping track of progress a well a easy break down and setup is great. it also becomes part of the story, in which there will be case where you’ll have to rest and save in order to trigger certain event and replenish certain resources. it’s all just brilliantly designed. so i just cannot sing the praise of this game enough. i know it’s a little tough to find, but if you manage to get your hand on a copy or have the chance to, i highly recommend checking it out a it is an incredible narrative gaming experience. plus, the company is so awesome that due to a printing hiccup the first time around, some of the card size were misprinted/miscut, and the company resent the proper sized card to replace the initial run, free of charge. i’m sure that wasn’t cheap, but it wa greatly appreciated. the customer service is top notch. i had the pleasure of meeting the designers/creators at gencon50, who walked me through a play through of the game and were extremely nice, personable, and passionate. they also have a kickstarter i think coming next year for their next entry in the choose your own adventure style gameplay called 7th citadel i think? i’ll definitely be on board day 1 of that a well. **tl;dr / in summary:** the 7th continent is an amazing gameplay experience and i highly recommend it. it play incredibly well solo and also is fun in a group setting. if you can find a copy, i cannot recommend enough that you get you pick it up. if you like this type of interactive narrative game, i don’t see how you could be disappointed. it’s definitely in my top 5 favorite game of all time, with it only downside being replayability is eventually spoiled by knowing what’s going to happen next, when the surprise is gone."

892,t3_cbqill,combining board game to make a bigger game!,32,"hi all, i recently read (can't remember exactly where) about someone who like to use a very short board game to replace an aspect of a different game. also found out that the century spice road game can be combined into one bigger game. so my question is this - what interesting and creative way can you all think of to combine multiple board game into one longer, epic game? example i can think of off the top of my head: 1. when you are supposed to ""go to jail"" in **monopoly**, instead play a game of **whitehall mystery** a the criminal and only go to jail if you get caught. 2. in **cosmic encounter**, convert the ship total + encounter card value to ship point value and play a round of **x-wing miniature game** to decide the combat 3. when you need to gather wood/food in **robinson crusoe**, instead of rolling the die that tell you if you succeeded play a game of **click clack lumberjack** or **let's go fishing!** and only take the resource if you manage to get a certain number of bark/fish looking for all kind of answers, ranging from realistically possible and fun, to ""not enough grain of sand in all the world to count the hour needed to play this""."
893,t3_cbue1h,any board game rental shop in ireland?,7,"next week i’m spending 7 day with my family in a small castle in the irish countryside near shannon. and it look like rain - perfect board game ambience! but i like to travel light so i don’t want to use 2/3rds of my luggage space on a big box game, but also because i want to play something challenging with my brothers, i don’t want to bring a party game. i want to play something that’ll take u a while, that we can set up and come back to over several days, like scythe or war of the ring or whathaveyou. a great solution would be a board game rental shop, ideally in dublin since that’s where i fly in and out (but it’s a small island so travel wouldn’t be out of the question) but google is not giving me anything. anyone know a good place?"
