2,,boardgames,"Hello r/boardgames,

me (Mateusz) and my friend Konrad are 2 software developers from Poland. Each of us already has a published book and now we want to share some knowledge with fun games.

The idea is simple: remember all the original 151 Pokemon names? How about playing a game that lets you remember something useful: like what technologies are beneficial to learn to be a better Developer. 
I'm working on a more general IT related game ""IT Startup"" and Konrad is creating something more programming oriented (.NET ecosystem edtion) ""OutOfMemory!"".

We are looking for feedback and want to show you our Print&amp;Play prototypes.
They can be downloaded from this blogpost: http://tooslowexception.com/outofmemory-and-it-startup-card-game-prototypes-available/

One of the games (""IT Startup"") is already published in Poland (the polish version was successfully crowdfunded and sold to this day over 3k copies) so we already have some publishing know how and want to go global next year. 
If you are interested in IT related games it would be great if you give our Print &amp; Play prototypes a try. Only honest feedback can help us make better games.

Have fun and take care,

This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter board game projects that are either:

- **newly posted in the past 7 days**, or
- **ending in the next 7 days (starting Jul 15)** and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.

All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, **no need to ask.** (The occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!)

Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between midnight and noon PST.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;#hmm&lt;/code&gt; means that something about the project seems a little off. Buyer beware kinda thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;#lolwut&lt;/code&gt; is reserved for projects that seem like copycat games or campaigns put together with little thought. Check &amp;#39;em out for amusement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;#take&lt;/code&gt; tags are for projects that have been restarted for some reason, with the number indicating what iteration we&amp;#39;re currently on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did I miss something? Particularly something &lt;strong&gt;new in the last 7 days&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;ending in the next 7 days&lt;/strong&gt;? Let me know in the comments and I&amp;#39;ll add it in.&lt;/li&gt;

5,,boardgames,"My wife and I picked up the game from a local store. It was beautiful, we love co-op, we love videogames, we love RPG mechanics, what was there not to be stoked about?! We watched the tutorial video, set up the most basic scenario, started leveling up. It was super fun!

... Until it wasn't anymore. Suddenly we found a monster that did 3 reflect damage as our second fight, thank the game gods we could camp him to death from inside the city. But after that things became more manageable, it was lovely exploring and getting gear, we had a lot of fun!

... Until we weren't. Because the objective was to get a ton of ore, and we would have needed to go buckwild leveling up our caravans to even get close to winning. We were doomed from turn 4 or so.

So we set up a story. Tried to plan out a bit better. I went hard healer, she went damage and worker wild. It was a ton of fun, tromping over the map, working together to finish quests!

... Until it wasn't. A monster popped up with 3 range and WAY more than enough damage to wipe us both out in a single attack. I'd been upping my HP and healing alternately, and I STILL was 1-shot-kill-able. I literally would have had to put every point into health from square one to tank even a single attack, and then I'd have been useless for everything else but that. And that's not including abilities.

We waited for game night. 4 people SURELY would be more balanced, right? My wife went full tank, I went full healer, one of our friends went damage and the other was god of workers.

... Following the rules of setup, the FIRST monster did 5 reflect damage, and did more than enough damage per attack to kill 1 if not 2 people. So that was a hard reset.

We cheated. Took the points for leveling up to the starting xp levels as well as the starting boosts. Started the enemies at level 1 instead of 5. And you know what? The game was really, super fun! We played around, joked, everyone got to do what they loved doing most, it was a fantastic time!

... Until it wasn't. The boss spawned. We had been leveling up a lot, had really solid gear. We were pretty speciallized, so we didn't run into the same problems as before where nobody had enough damage to justify hitting a reflect, or enough up to take even a single hit. But the boss spawned with an ability called 'Whirlwind' (random chance to get that...) Which deals half his attack to all nearby allies of the main target.

Now, the TANK had 20 hp, and the boss had 16 FRELLING ATTACK. So the tank barely survived. Whirlwind, however, team wiped the rest of us, none of us having specced into health enough to suddenly eat 8 damage, not when you factored in all the poison and fire he was making appear everywhere as well, when the game had taught us the gospel of ""specialize, specialize, specialize!"" So we IMMEDEATELY, without any chance to react or have any warning, the first turn the boss appeared, in spite of the fact we cheated to be massively overleveled for where the game SAID we should be, lost in a single attack when he killed all 3 of us.

That wasn't fun. And it didn't feel like we'd planned poorly, or like we had been out strategied or like there was a single damn thing we could do about it. We died, it felt like, because ""F*ck you"", and there was no reason any other outcome should have been expected.

In my experiance, City of Kings is beautiful, clever, wild, fantastic, and a pure joy to play, especilly with friends when you each get to play the way you all want to play. The problem is when the game abruptly, and without warning, decides that the fun is over, and if you aren't positioned like x or specd out like y or have at least a in b stat, you lose now. Thanks for playing, jerkwad.

Our worker player felt AWFUL because once the boss spawned, she couldn't do much, and ended up being one of the ones who died. The game directly punished her for doing what it claimed she should have been more than free to do, to play her hero the way she deemed most enjoyable.

I don't know when we'll be playing again. If we even will. But I know I'll WANT to. I'll remember the good times. Roaming the board with friends, leveling up, beating monsters and completing quests. But I'll always remember ""this guy does 16 damage to the tank, and 8 damage to everyone else. Then he spawns fire and poison everywhere."" ""So... We lose then?"" ""...Yea. I guess. Huh. That sucks.""

Got the standard version of Dinosaur Island on a whim the other day and was disappointed with the uniform and boring plastic dinosaur meeples, as well as the flimsy cardboard hexagons for the scientists.

I considered getting those upgrade packs for lots of monies or get something off etsy. Took a gamble and got tiny “rubber eraser” dinosaurs from amazon. They cost like ten bucks for 150(!) of them, in different models and colors. Turns out they fit the game’s paddocks perfectly and, being rubber, feel perfect as well. I was worried they’d just fall apart, but they’re quite sturdy!

Now I assume that since those are rubber erasers, they will disintegrate over time. We’ll see. But for now I recommend this as a great and dirt cheap way to upgrade your Dinosaur Island.

21,,boardgames,"Hello Ticket To Ride fans!

I am pleased to announce the launch of **Ticket To Ride Score Calculator app for Android**!

The app allows you to scan your Ticket To Ride game board using your **phone's camera** to calculate the game scores automatically!

Ticket To Ride is a great board game, but counting the final score at the end can be so annoying sometimes.There's the score marker, but more often than not, someone will forget to move it during the game and you end up counting the scores manually.

With this app you can simply take a picture of the game board using your phone's camera and it will automatically recognize player trains and calculate the scores for you!

Here’s the app in Android Play Store: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buslovsky....](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buslovsky.ttrsc) .
You can find additional information and support the project on the website: [http://serg.buslovsky.com/ttrsc/](http://serg.buslovsky.com/ttrsc/) .
And a video overview here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m\_M\_zGK87j0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_M_zGK87j0) .

Support for iOS(Apple) device is coming soon!

Enjoy!

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to announce the launch of &lt;strong&gt;Ticket To Ride Score Calculator app for Android&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app allows you to scan your Ticket To Ride game board using your &lt;strong&gt;phone&amp;#39;s camera&lt;/strong&gt; to calculate the game scores automatically!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ticket To Ride is a great board game, but counting the final score at the end can be so annoying sometimes.There&amp;#39;s the score marker, but more often than not, someone will forget to move it during the game and you end up counting the scores manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this app you can simply take a picture of the game board using your phone&amp;#39;s camera and it will automatically recognize player trains and calculate the scores for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the app in Android Play Store: &lt;a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buslovsky.ttrsc""&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buslovsky....&lt;/a&gt; .
You can find additional information and support the project on the website: &lt;a href=""http://serg.buslovsky.com/ttrsc/""&gt;http://serg.buslovsky.com/ttrsc/&lt;/a&gt; .
And a video overview here: &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_M_zGK87j0""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_M_zGK87j0&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support for iOS(Apple) device is coming soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

41,,boardgames,"So I have a vacation home in the Pacific northwest. I invited several friends to go relax, retreat, and game, but most of the time it was my best buddy and me. We created a gaming Olympiad, a heptathalon (if that's a word), and I'm going to tell you all about it! If you wanna read only about certain events, you can skip forward to:

1: pixel tactics

2: mtg power cubes

3: deck builders

4: EPIC

5: battlecon

6: Carl Chudyk

7: Food Chain Magnate 

&amp;&amp;&amp;

The Olympiad consisted of 7 events, or pillars. First to win 4 takes it down. We jumped around from pillar to pillar each day to prevent burn out on one game.

&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;

Pillar 1: pixel tactics constructed. Create 3 decks from all the sets. Play each deck versus each opposing deck twice each (18 games) plus one game with the deck of your choice. Best 10/19 games takes the pillar. This pillar took an incredible amount of prep. We had to sort through about 15 cards and pick 3 leaders to build around. That took days of analysis paralysis. Ultimately, the leaders I picked hard countered a couple of his. Like, he had Byron (all your dudes have two life but only ever take one damage) and I had Lixis (1 damage to all opposing dudes every wave). He had Adjenna (opponents can't use clear corpse action) and I had Luca (you can redraw top card of discard pile if you use it right away, ie spam revive corpse orders). After about 8 matches and having seen each of our leaders, he scooped the pillar to me to save time. And no, there was no coming back, his scoop was not premature.

&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;

Pillar 2: MtG Power Cubes. I have two vintage powered cubes. One that is more combo oriented and balanced, and one that has almost no combo and is more interactive. So we started with the combo cube. We pack drafted two decks simultaneously, having to allocate each drafted card to deck A or B. Then each deck played each opposing deck in a best 3/5 match. That's 4 matches so far. Then we used the other cube and simultaneously drafted 3 decks and played each against each other in a 3/5 (9 more matches). Best 7/13 matches takes the pillar. 

So in the first cube, I dominated. Drafted a show n tell style deck and a mono green crater hoof natural order deck. He drafted a reanimator deck and a mono white control/Armageddon/winter orb/stax deck. Both mine beat both of his and I took a 4-0 match advantage. Then on the other cube, I drafted mono red aggro, mono white midrange, and UB control. He drafted esper control, jund midrange, and WG aggro. He stormed back! My red deck lost two matches them barely beat wg on a mana screw. Then my W deck went 0-3. So now the match score is 5-5!!! First to 7 takes the pillar. Then my UB beats jund, barely, with game 5 ending in such a grind that he decks out. 6-5. Then my UB beats wg and takes down the pillar! Extremely nerve wracking. I thought he was gonna crack my 4-0 lead!!!

&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;

Pillar 3: deck building. So we were really limited on games due to suitcase space. So in this pillar, we would play Star Realms, Tanto Cuore, and Flip City, each best 3/5. Whoever wins two of those three takes the pillar. We start with star realms. I win two in a row then he wins 3. Then we play flip city and he sweeps me. Takes down the pillar in under 2 hours!!

&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;

Pillar 4: EPIC. So for those not familiar, this game is kinda mtg: lite. So we each have 3 sets of cards. We started by open drafting a deck and playing 3/5, which I took down. Then we constructed 2 decks each and played 4 matches best 3/5 each. We split those. I took down the pillar best 3 of 5 matches (each 3/5 games). Interestingly, one pair of decks we each built was quite similar, a red yellow control deck with lots of removal and recursion.

&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;

Pillar 5: battlecon. So we each drafted 20 fighters and split them into 5 teams of 4. We use each team once, best 3/5 matches (one team versus another team for a match). The format was this: simultaneously ban an opposing fighter. Then play best of 3. Game 1 you simultaneously pick an opposing fighter they can't use in game 1. Game two features an arena effect. Best 2/3 takes the match. 

Match 1: the game 2 arena says that each beat, you gain a life if you didn't hit the opposing fighter. I ban Madelina (scary) and he bans Seth. Game 1: my Prince Elien loses to Clinhyde as I'm unable to ever benefit from my wall protection. Game 2 is my Tatsumi versus his Runika. We dance around forever. I'm trying to gradually pick off his artifacts before engaging. Late, I end up making a blunder on a beat where he couldn't even reach me by waking forward directly into his fist and giving the game away. He's up 1 match to none.

Match 2. The game 2 arena gradually fills the board up with candles on your space, end of beat, or damages you if you're on one. When board is full of candles, you can then ante candles you're on to gain various effects, including ignore stun guard. He bans aria, I ban shekhtur. 

Game 1: my burgundy loses to his lymn. Lymn constantly causes prio mix ups and I was repeatedly wrong. Game 2 my Karin plays way too predictably and loses to his main, zaamassal. He takes match 2 and now I'm totally in my own head, feeling like he can read me at every decision.

Match 3: the game 2 arena says you can fall off the edge of the board and take 4 damage. I ban Wardlaw, his 3-4th main. He bans khadath. By the way, each of these battlecon matches was a different day, allowing the loser top rest and recoup. I reached the conclusion that I had been playing on yomi level zero (ie just playing what I thought were good attack pairs) and he was anticipating those. I went back to my old method of analyzing what his most likely pairs were. Game 1 my lucida crushes his merjoram. Both characters want to stand still and trade. Mine just does it better. He also didn't have his full concentration that day, hard reading me on several beats and just being bad at math and punting. Game 2 my Jin beats his Sarafina. Sara is one of my mains, which he hate drafted not really knowing how to use her. I hard read him a couple times, and my movement and hit confirm nullified his mix ups. I win the set 2-0 and trail 1 match to 2.

Match 4: the game 2 arena says each beat has a 50% chance of recycling backwards. I ban Hepzibah (our consensus #1 pick agreed) he bans Kajia. Game 1 my rukyuk beats his iaxus. Neither of us plays these characters much, but I get there. Game 2 i got what I thought was a good match up, my malandrax versus his kehrolyn, but I actually had trouble keeping her off me and he got there. 1-1. Game 3 my clive versus his cadenza. He remarks that this is a great matchup for him since he can stun me off my modules. I stay silent. Basically I take one big hit and then keep him at bay the rest of the game. He even lands a grapnel but I foresee this and use the thing that negates his on hit effects, so he can't pull me. I take it down easily. 2-2 in matches. Fortunately I have my strongest team last. 

Match 5: game 2 arena says the lower health player can move a barrier marker and nobody can end their movement on it. I ban Adjenna, his second main, he bans Thessala, my #1 pick. 
Game 1 my Cherri squeaks out a win against cesar. Game 2 in the arena is my lesandra versus his lixis. I request we play game 3 first since i have a great matchup, which we do. My baenvier crushes his orianna. I wait till he commits a lot of magic points to an attack them simply negate our styles, rendering his character practically useless. I win the final match and thus the pillar (making a huge comeback) and thus the entire Olympiad.

&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;

Pillar 6: chudyk. Best 4/7 mottainai, best 2/3 impulse, best 2/3 GTR. Whoever wins two of those takes it. He wins mottainai 4-3 but we don't end up completing the pillar because I won battlecon that afternoon and ended it. 

&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;

Pillar 7: beat 2/3 food chain magnate. Didn't start this one.

&lt;p&gt;This is meant to be a place where you can ask any and all questions relating to the board gaming world: general or specific game recommendations, rule clarifications, definitions of terms/acronyms, and other quick questions that might not warrant their own post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are seeking game recommendations you will get better responses if you give us enough background to help you. You can use &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template-no-explainer""&gt;this template&lt;/a&gt; to do so. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a version with explanations of what we&amp;#39;re looking for.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you reply to any comment that has a game name in &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt; with &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/r2d8""&gt;/u/r2d8&lt;/a&gt; getparentinfo&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, one of our robots will tell you more about the game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember that this is a community full of awesome, helpful people, and feel free to ask your questions whatever they may be. As always, keep it civil and remember what the downvote button is actually for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, here are some of the resources available at &lt;a href=""/r/boardgames""&gt;/r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just got them done today. The laminate is 10m matte. Got them done at Staples. Cost was 82$CAD. Definately worth it. The race sheets fit in legal size laminate pouches, and 2 command mats fit into 1 ledger size pouch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rounded the corners before and after lamination, and wiped them down before lamination as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should mention, my camera glass is broken. Any foggyness is not because of the lamination, it&amp;#39;s my camera. The race sheets are crystal clear.&lt;/p&gt;

70,,boardgames,"So I've had a rough experience with Asmodee Games, and wanted to share, see if I'm alone. 

My housemate has a copy of El Grande big box, which as it is famously known has game breaking errors on  two action cards. He contacted Asmodee last year, asking for replacements, and they denied him this, saying they do not replace for errata. Fine. They somehow had the resources to print the nature of the error on the rule book, but not include replacements for those cards in the actual game. It's a $AUD 140 game by the way. 

After looking around online, it seems that some people had received replacements of these cards from Asmodee, so their decision as to whether to assist seems variable, perhaps depending on which representative happens to read your request on whatever particular day. Who knows. 

After hearing of others success, he contacted them again,  and same response, they don't service for errata. Ridiculous, given how much had been spent on the game, and how easily it could be rectified. 

After looking around online, I saw that the later printings of this game from 2018 onwards seem to have this error corrected. So I hunted around and bought a copy of this. I know the printing is correct because the rulebook doesn't have the error mentioned on it. But lo and behold, this particular copy happened to have some cards missing from the box, and naturally, it happened to be the very action cards that I purchased this game specifically for. 

So I immediately contacted Asmodee, clearly explaining the problem, and they were kind enough to send out replacements. 5 weeks pass, the package arrives, and they sent the wrong deck of cards. No big deal, they were kind enough to help,easy mistake to make (even though I clearly described the cards in the parts request), so I contact them yet again. They mail out the package, a month  ago, and with a tracking number.  The package is now lost in transit, stuck at a USPS centre in Green Bay, where it has been for 4 weeks now. 

I've contacted USPS and stamps, who got back to me immediately saying to follow up with the sender. So back to Asmodee again, and they have't returned my emails for several weeks. 

I filed another replacement request and have heard nothing back.

Is this a common experience for everyone?

Between us we've spent 300 on this game, and we have one broken copy and a copy missing cards that are essential to play.

77,,boardgames,"Hey guys, I'm basically the host whenever we have a board game session, so I read through the rules and played finish our first game. It was super intense, and we all came in like 58, 58 and 57.

Anyway, I've got a couple of questions:

1) In the context of a new game / fresh board, it seems that oceans are a bad idea in terms of 'competitiveness'. It does not reward/incentivize anything. What I mean is: you spend resources placing an ocean down, and you don't even get the bonus. ANYONE ELSE can get the bonus. So you, as the person placing it, spend resources to put in a tile in which you only benefit from +1 to TR and placement bonuses, whereas someone else could just wait it out, place a greenery tile, own the area (which counts towards the landlord award and gardener milestone), get +1 to TR as well, AND also +1 VP from the greenery itself. (Not to mention +1 if he owns a city beside it). Thus I am having a hard time comprehending why would anybody want to ever place an ocean first. The opportunity cost is so much greater than if you were to just spend the same amount of resources building a greenery.

2) Some cards say ""require 7% oxygen"", I'm assuming this is require 7% oxygen OR GREATER, correct? Because it wouldn't be logical if it was literally playable on exactly 7% oxygen levels. (Asking this because some of the cards are worded with ""X% or less"" or ""X% or more"" whereas some cards dont have these texts)

3) Some cards say, for example, add 2 microbes / animals to ANOTHER card. Does this mean that you must have another card that ""collects"" these resources? E.g. decomposers card collects microbes, so you can only add the microbes to this card, correct? I'm guessing if you don't have decomposers, or any other micro-resource collection card, then basically you can't add these micro-resources.

4) Because there are so many things to track / move everytime you do something, e.g. paying 8 plants to add a greenery tile, you have to physically move the cubes back to the cube pile, then add your tile, put the player marker, add the TR, raise the oxygen, and even many other power cards that may or may not activate. Thus, if a player forgets the passive of these cards, what's the best play here? Allow the player to retroactively get the resources or just too bad for him cuz he wasted his resources?

5) In terms of the ""sabotage"" cards, e.g. meteors or asteroids which will remove plant resources from a player, what is the incentive of NOT doing so? It seems logical to ALWAYS do it (it is a competitive game after all) but the rules mention something about it being 'optional' and that 'it is not very nice' to do so.

83,,boardgames,"In *Century Spice Road*, and *Architects of the West Kingdom*, and *Pax Pamir 2E*, there is a mechanic where you are buying cards from a row. The cards on the lowest spot are free/set price, the cards on the second lowest are +1 coin, and so on. In addition, you put the additional coins you are paying on the cards you are skipping over. So, for example, if I was buying a card from the 3rd column, I would put a coin on the cards in the 1st and 2nd columns. Anyone who bought those cards later would get to keep the coins built up on the card. Also, at the end of the round/turn, the cards slide down, and new cards are drawn to fill the holes at the expensive end.

So my question is: this is a very specific mechanic, which I am surprised to see in so many games. Which game pioneered this mechanic? Which was the *first*?

Do you think I should buy the organizer now, or later? Is broken token reputable? Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

106,,boardgames,"*Sorry about the long post. It had to be.*

I have been blown away by Pax Pamir (second edition). I have played probably over 300 games which include some really heavy Euros, war games, American games right up to party games and roll and writes. I mean I'm very familiar with board game systems and mechanics and I generally know what to expect in a certain type of board game. Despite this, Pax Pamir (second edition) blew me away.

I had not played any of the pax games before. This was my first. The playthrough video by Heavy Cardboard piqued my interest for the game (which is exactly why they make these videos I suppose). I normally to skip through and watch only parts of play through videos to see the board art, player boards and a couple of turns. Cole Wehrle, the designer, who was also on the playthrough seemed like a good bloke with lot of humility and knowledge, explained the game in an interesting manner, which made me watch through the entire episode.

In the first two weeks itself, this had seen about 10 plays which is the highest in our group(family) for any game, let alone a game of this depth. Here's my quick summary of the game:

**Story**: Players are local tribal leaders in Afghanistan who are vying for a position in this great war and political dance among the three big factions (British, Russians &amp;amp; Afghans) fighting for dominance. In the game you're trying to do either of these things: (a) make your allied faction dominant and ensure that you have the most influence with this faction (b) if you can't achieve in making your faction most dominant or unable to have most influence with them, you ensure that you are the most powerful local tribal leader with most of your folk out there in the action. This summary itself should tell you this is not your run-of-the-mill board game. 

Some positives:

**Components**: This could be the first reason why anyone who's never player a Pax game may be interested in Pax Pamir (second edition). The game looks gorgeous with the beuaitful fabric map, resin pieces in pastel colours and the awesome best-in-business metal coins (if you got those). You can come for the looks, but you're going to certainly stay for the game. 

**Minimal set up**: This is an important consideration for us. We have sold some good games for set up being too long and complicated for what it actually offers. This game has minimal set up for the depth and experience it offers. Time to first turn (from deciding to play to the first turn of the game) is just probably 5 mins. The only set up action is setting up the 58 card deck (for a 3 player game) which is super simple. 

**Low fiddliness**: Normally it's the number of components and the need for bookkeeping that drive the fiddliness in a game. This game has fewer components and probably no book keeping per se. This means low fiddliness which in turn results in quality time spent on playing the game rather than 'managing the game'. 

**Simple gameplay**: Very easy to teach and very easy to learn. In every turn, you play two actions - which is a combination or repetition of (a) buy a card (b) play a card (c) take the action from an already played card. This is all you're ever going to do. But you will have choices, numerous choices. You can teach the game 10-15 mins and start playing and introduce new concepts as you go along. 

**Depth of decisions**: I believe the quality of a board game is directly proportional to the quality of the decisions in that board game. In Pax Pamir (second edition), the decisions are very interesting and excruciating. And every decision you take can have a lasting impact on the progress of the game.

*Consideration #1*: Do I want to buy a card or play a card or use an action from a played card? 

*Consideration #2*: Which card to buy - which one do I want, which one do I want to deny for my opponents, which ones can I and my opponents afford, which card helps my present, which card may help my future. 

*Consideration #3*: With the tight tableau and hand limits, the one I buy and the one I play is really worth its place in the tableau or the hand. Which of the cards in my hand provide the best instant impact when I play them.

*Consideration #4*: Should I forgo the buying or playing of a card (and let my opponents expand) and use an action from a played card. Some actions require certain conditions to be present and require some cost.

*Consideration #5*: Am I with the right faction? Do they have the chance of achieving domination? Even if they do, can I be the one with most influence with this faction? Is someone else pushing another faction despite having low influence with them? Do I need to change loyalties? At which point do I change loyalty? Should I forgo current/upcoming scoring with a big play in the future scoring? How can I increase my presence and that of my faction? How can I reduce the presence of opponents and their factions?

Most heavy games require fair amount of number crunching and that sometimes in itself is a major contributor to the crunchiness of the game. In this game, there's almost no math except the additions which won't even involve double digit numbers usually. The decisions in this game is brain burny in a totally new way. 

The manner in which the decisions in this game are simple as well as carry the depth is really insane. This game is a great example that a heavy game need not be complex. It can be very simple and still be a heavy game requiring a lot of solid decision making. 

**Fantastic player interaction**: When the game creates a puzzle for you, it so happens that you can sit in your corner and solve it and check were you the first one to solve or were you the one to solve in the most efficient way. Most of the euros (that I like) are of this kind. But when the puzzle is created and shaped by your fellow players, you need to interact with them and outsmart them. The player interaction in this game is something that's very unique and very unlike anything I've seen in other games. It's so in-your-face but also it's not that mean. The whole game is about shifting loyalties, betraying and backstabbing so you almost come to expect a level of meanness. You may end up joining hands with the very player that backstabbed you last turn because it helps your cause to work with her now. It's interesting the game doesn't feel like a mean game despite all this fierce interaction. That in itself is a great accomplishment by the designer. 

**Tabletalk**: This is an important consideration in our games, especially the bigger games. I always assess a game based on how much and what kind of table talk the game creates. The table talk in this game is super interesting. Due to the fact that you're constantly trying to jockey for positions all through the game, it's impossible to play this game without any tabletalk. You have to 'help' the other player in making the right decision to ensure another player doesn't walk away with the game, only for her to clarify how if anything that would help me immensely in progressing my objectives if my advice is implemented. There are no permanent friends or permanent enemies in this game so this non-stop table talk totally brings the game alive. 

**Thrilling gameplay**: I love some drama in my games. The way the game unfolds each time we play is so unique and always tells a different story. Everytime we have played a game of Pax Pamir (second edition) we fondly recollect and summarize the story of the game that developed like a movie. With such variety of decisions available at your disposal, it's totally possible for a player to come up with a really creative solution to a problem that involves a sequence of actions, cajoling of opponents and some luck to pull a rabbit out of their hat. The game offers many many such moments of magic. Also, there's always some suspense in the air about what's going to happen next in the game. The more people play this game, the more unpredictable their play becomes. This is what makes the gameplay absolutely a thrilling experience. 

**Strategic as well as tactical**: Its not often games can combine strategy and tactics in equal measure. If the game is too tactical, you will go through the motions and open yourselves to the luck of the draw. If the game is too strategic, the game can be a bit of a drag with less interesting things to do on a turn by turn basis. If you hit the right balance, you have a winner. In this game, you're going to have three or four scoring opportunities in the game. Your position in relation to the board state at those junctures determine where you land on the scoring track. So you're always thinking of where you want to be when those scoring opportunities arise. But you need to keep an eye on the current pressures and quick wins too as they have a huge impact on the board state. 

**Replayability**: The game comes with about 120 cards of which only half of it may be used in a game. The cards that come out, the sequence in which it comes out, the faction arrangement among the players, timing of the scoring cards (called the dominance cards) all ensure that there's a unique experience everytime you play the game. This also means the replayability is incredible. The real proof is in wanting to play the game several times over a weekend and still not feeling samey about any of those games. Even the best of games (medium to heavy ones) need some time gap between plays to keep it fresh and interesting. The fact that you can play Pax Pamir back to back to back and still get a brand new experience is a testimony to its replayability. 

**Super-thematic**: You don't need highly evocative art and miniatures to tell a story. This game has theme dripping in every rule and action - the shifting of loyalty, prizes and gifts to win influence, tribes of the same faction not fighting on the map but using spies to fight out of the factions' sight, changing political climate, paying bribes and so on. After any game of Pax Pamir (second edition), you can narrate the game in such a way it may sound like a piece of history. There can be a cohesive story. Also, the card art is well done and the flavor text has lots of historical information of the period and the 'great game' of 19th century. 

**Wakhan!**: Wakhan is the solo mode AI character that is built not just to mess with your plans but also to go for the win by herself. To state a fact, in the games where we included Wakhan, she has a win rate of about 60-70%. This little deck of AI cards is a brilliant piece of work. It simplifies the AI turns and adds a lot of drama and gives a bloody good competitor for the human players to worry about and to target. Wakhan can be introduced not only on solo games but also as a third player with two human players. Funny times when the human players support the same faction and target Wakhan and her faction. To build a functional and competent AI in a game that involves backstabbing, betrayal, heavy player interaction etc sounds like a really challenging job and the team has pulled it off with flying colours. 

**Value for money**: The way I assess the value of a game, the quantity and quality of plays of this game mean the value has already exceeded the price I paid for this game and it will only increase with time. This game needs no expansion because it's complete as it is. You can buy this off the shelf and get a full value for money. I can be greedy and want more cards in future but it's not necessary at all. Same with the components. No need to bling the game as the retail game comes blinged. The only exception is the metal coins. It's not a must but it certainly adds certain something to the game. These are some of the best metal coins I've seen in a game with the right weight, size, colour and art. 

Some of the best games I like involve heavy set up, high fiddliness, crunchy calculations, minimal interactions, minimal table talk and steady, predictable game play and soem get played once in a year putting a question on the value for money. I never thought I'd find a deep and heavy game, that's got minimal set up, low fiddliness, minimal to no mathematics, excellent table talk, thrilling game play with a high value for money.

If I nit pick, I can find some negatives even with my most favourite games that I'd rate a 10 (like Twilight Struggle, Dominant Species, Le Havre, Wildcatters, Castell etc). I'd find it really hard to come up with any negatives for Pax Pamir (second edition). 

And even these favorites sometimes need me in a certain mood and mindset to play. As much as I adore Twilight Struggle, I'm not going to say yes everytime someone asks to play it. But I think I've found my 'always ready to play, all the time' kinda game in Pax Pamir (second edition). Of all adjectives and superlatives I've used in this piece, this is probably the highest praise I can give for this game. Plus, of course, if it's not clear yet, this has become my #1 game of all time moving ahead of all the other board game stalwarts. Yup, this #1868 ranked game in BGG list has become my most favourite game.",t2_14cw5j,False,,0,False,How Pax Pamir (second edition) stunned me with its brilliance . . .,[],r/boardgames,False,6,,0,,False,t3_cc5ib0,False,dark,,public,135,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,135,,self,1562907278.0,hansa-teutonica,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'After the game, the king and the pawn go into the same box . . .'}]",{},,True,,1562930588.0,text,6,,richtext,self.boardgames,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sorry about the long post.

The next game we chose whatever spirit we wanted, then played powers normally, drawing from the top of the deck and discarding the rest.

We played these games without adversaries, and ended up winning both games in reasonable amounts of time, once we got the main mechanics down. I won't say it was easy but it certainly wasn't super hard like I thought it would be.

My wife and I want to play 2 player, and take it to the next level of difficulty. Do we introduce adversaries now? Are there spirit combos that make things easier and harder?

&lt;p&gt;We started on the easiest mode, using the low level difficulty spirits, as well as the power progression cards, for major and minor powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next game we chose whatever spirit we wanted, then played powers normally, drawing from the top of the deck and discarding the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We played these games without adversaries, and ended up winning both games in reasonable amounts of time, once we got the main mechanics down. I won&amp;#39;t say it was easy but it certainly wasn&amp;#39;t super hard like I thought it would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife and I want to play 2 player, and take it to the next level of difficulty. Do we introduce adversaries now? Are there spirit combos that make things easier and harder? I&amp;#39;m interested in learning a lot more about the game but don&amp;#39;t know where to go from the base that we started with. Thanks for the help!&lt;/p&gt;

The theme was a bit of a turn off, but would not stop me from enjoying the game. 
    So am I taking crazy pills, is this game awesome? Did I let a boring box and theme cloud my judgment? or is my gut correct and I should pass on this next time it come out?&lt;/p&gt;

123,,boardgames,"a few weeks ago I picked up Red Dragon Inn 1 and 2 and started playing it with my entire family and surprisingly everyone seemed to have really enjoyed it.

130,,boardgames,"Recently I've been thinking of testing a concept I came up with, ""Adversarial Spirits"". These are spirits that are, for some reason or another, acting against the wishes of the player-controlled spirits. Some might be doing it to get revenge on other spirits or the Dahan, some might enjoy the invaders' presence on the island, and some might be doing it inadvertently. I'm interested in what others think about this idea, especially the actual mechanics involved. I've thought of a lot of different ways to make adversarial spirits both viable and fun, but I'm not sure which mechanics might actually work.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this corrects a problem that I've found in Spirit Island: the end games are often very anti-climactic. You usually know whether or not you'll win ages before the end of the game. Adversarial Spirits would become stronger as the game goes on, leading to a sort of 'final boss' you need to overcome before the end of the game.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this next bit is the part I am least sure about. I think that Adversarial Spirits could have their own unique powers, sorted into different power levels (I am unsure if this should be random or a known progression). Each adversary would have their cards drawn in response to different player-actions: some might activate a card every time a city is destroy, or every time a fear card is drawn, etc. This might overwhelm the player, but it also might lead to interesting decisions. For example, destroying cities becomes something that might not always be beneficial since it could activate an adversarial card before the player is ready to deal with its effects.

&amp;#x200B;

***Edit:*** I seem to have been a little unclear about how the spirits would work. I do not think turning this wonderful co-op game into a competitive game would work well. It would be a radical change and would require years of testing, and I have neither the time nor the desire to do that. The idea is that the Adversarial Spirits would be automated somehow, though I'm not sure exactly how that would work.

&amp;#x200B;

Some ideas for adversarial spirits:

&amp;#x200B;

The Heart of Heroes: The Heart of Heroes in humans or spirits overcoming overwhelming odds and triumphing in the face of adversary. Because of this it will actively make the spirits and Dahan's job dealing with the invaders harder. The Heart also finds the invaders intrepid nature and bravery (they are moving to a completely new land and dealing with terrifying supernatural creations after all) inspiring. It will sometimes challenge the invaders as well and make their job harder, as well as aid the Dahan and, potentially, the spirits.

&amp;#x200B;

Wisdom of the Cloudbreaker: A spirit who only desires to accumulate knowledge and information. Cloudbreaker actively aided the Dahan during the First and Second Reckoning by fighting against some of the sky-based Spirits, thus earning its name. The coming of the invaders has dramatically increased its access to human knowledge, and so it will fight to keep the newcomers from being forced off the island. Most of its cards focus on defending the invaders from the spirits powers, but many of its cards will protect the Dahan as well. Will sometimes target Spirits.

&amp;#x200B;

They who Swear Vengeance: They who Swear Vengeance actively desires to destroy the Dahan. They who Swear's cards focus purely on eradicating the Dahan, whether that is by making them attack wild beasts, forcing them into the sea, causing the invaders to wage war upon them, or by simply destroying them with fire and fury.

&amp;#x200B;

Hellbringer: Unsure about backstory. Wants to destroy the land itself. Focuses on creating uninhabitable zones and a lot of blight. Directly works against the Spirits and all humans.

&amp;#x200B;

138,,boardgames,"Tldr at bottom. Just wanted to share my somewhat new found love for board games.

My wife and I were getting bored of video games and most of the time we played our own games separately so drifted apart a bit. Star Wars rebellion came out and I was soooo excited: I used to play the video game it I was based off of, not many people played it so it was awesome it kinda came back. 

My wife was skeptical but she's a star wars fan also so we went for it. We ended up loving it despite it being a somewhat complex game for us at the time. After awhile we stopped playing because we didn't like playing against each other.

 Coop games right. I wanted a DnD like adventure game with single player for myself and went for Runebound third edition (liked the no dice, token idea) Ended up not being balanced well. The token system ended up being a little disappointing. So that was a bust, also didn't get into the theme. 

Then came pandemic which was a savior. My wife is a nurse so she delved into the theme. It's a true coop game where runebound you basically just traded cards. It's just an awesome simple enough game. We play 2 player but I want to try 2 player with 4 characters. I just bucked up and got the 10th anniversary edition in the metal case. Totally worth it.

Star Wars Outer Rim! We literally (seriously) played it every night since I got it. This is what sold us on board games (with pandemics help) The theme is obvious, adventure awesome, solid balance. I've heard there are similar games that are supposedly better, but star wars. The solo ai is kinda clunky. We're thinking of adding an ai player as a third to mix it up. We've also mixed up the board.

Next game we want is Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle Earth. It's everything we want in a game: single player, coop, adventure, theme (wife had a lotr themed sixteen bday cake...). We love getting in character, upgrading, leveling up, combat but also using skills for adventure stuff. Outer rim is really cool like that. Buy a ship, get some mods, gear, crew. Being han and getting the falcon is awesome but also switching it up like han teaming up with greedo in slave 1.

Everybody gets on ff for putting out unfinished games and selling expansions. I don't feel that way with rebellion or outer rim. Still haven't got rebellions expansion, probably will cause rogue one is my favorite star wars movie (after empire)

So now we are addicted to board games. My hope is that we start getting better with learning rules and going for really complex games. Also trying to get some friends into it. Looking forward to lotr: journeys for now.

Tldr: wife and I got sick of video games. Get star wars rebellion cause I used to play the video game. Loved it. Wanted single player and coop, tried Runebound 3rd edition, disappointed. Pandemic 10th anniversary edition is awesome and saved the day.  Then Outer rim which is awesome also, we love star wars btw. Next is Lord of the Rings journey in middle Earth.

143,,boardgames,"As the title states, I played **Ethnos** for the first time last night. We played with 4. None of us had played before. We learned the rules and played our whole first game in under 80 minutes!! So now that I know rules, it will go significantly faster. I can definitely see how this game could fly through rounds. 


&amp;nbsp;


So there are obviously better tribes than others in this game. Wingfolk and Wizards became quick grabs by most at the table. But I was able to sneak in a couple 6 Halfling bands to get a bunch of points. 


&amp;nbsp;


The tenseness of waiting on the Dragons is just silly fun. There is a lot less area control than I realized. The card sets you make are vastly more important than just winning territories (though winning a couple territories is absolutely necessary for winning). 


&amp;nbsp;


Contrary to popular opinion, the board art and the plastic pieces are actually not that bad. I didn't mind the simplicity of it. I think it makes the board less overwhelming for new gamers. The neon pieces are fun to look at and easy to distinguish. The card art, while not impressive, is also not that bad either. 

&amp;nbsp;


*HOWEVER*, the card quality...yikes. It is just embarrassing.  Shuffling was a drag. Cut out card sized shapes from a cereal box. Shuffle those. It will be better than these things. 

&amp;nbsp;


Overall though, in spite of the terrible card quality, I think this might be a gateway that flies under so many people's radars. It is relatively cheap too. This game is just an easy decision making, silly, and fun game. I definitely recommend it as a game to get non-gamers to the table.

145,,boardgames,"Okay, I admit I'm not the best gamer ever, but I can't believe I'm also the worst. Basically, I'm okay playing boardgames because I love the puzzle and if I come close to victory but just don't quite eek it out, i'm fine. 

I'm having trouble tho winning two-player Inis. I've probably played about 20 games mano y mano and I cant beat my nephew's strategy of building up a giant army to defend 5-6 sanctuaries. He can pretty methodically build up and army to defend a growing # of sanctuaries pretty quickly using the sanctuary card or druid. 

It seems like other strategies of exploration and domination usually arent viable. Exploration spreads you too thin and dominating a force that size is incredibly difficult especially since he'll usually also have several epic tales to help.

Anyone have any thoughts on beating this strategy? I will be eternally grateful to you all if i could finally beat the little ***.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m having trouble tho winning two-player Inis. I&amp;#39;ve probably played about 20 games mano y mano and I cant beat my nephew&amp;#39;s strategy of building up a giant army to defend 5-6 sanctuaries. He can pretty methodically build up and army to defend a growing # of sanctuaries pretty quickly using the sanctuary card or druid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like other strategies of exploration and domination usually arent viable. Exploration spreads you too thin and dominating a force that size is incredibly difficult especially since he&amp;#39;ll usually also have several epic tales to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone have any thoughts on beating this strategy? I will be eternally grateful to you all if i could finally beat the little ***. &lt;/p&gt;

148,,boardgames," Just kidding. The game is freaking great. And here's my review to explain why:

&amp;#x200B;

Alright Class. Take a seat.

&amp;#x200B;

Today we’re learning about Agent: The Consortium.

&amp;#x200B;

It  starts with the Chancellor Nostros Calahaan’s resignation and a vacant  job position which pays a cushy salary and allows you to wear your Harry  Potter cosplay without judgement. So of course, you need to apply.

&amp;#x200B;

**Name:** Argent the Consortium

**Players:** 2-5

**Publishers:** LVL99 Games

**Year Published:** 2015

**Designer:** Trey Chambers

**Artists**: Jennifer Easley, Eunice Abigael Tiu

&amp;#x200B;

But it’s won't be easy.

&amp;#x200B;

A panel of twelve secret judges selects who’s going to sit in the chair, and it’s up to you to win their favour.

&amp;#x200B;

But who are they? And what do they want?

&amp;#x200B;

Welcome  to Argent the Consortium. Victory lies in you winning over the majority  of the panel, but each judge wants something different from their  candidate. From the richest, to most mana hungry, to most influential,  to the candidate with the most support. These judges start the game face  down. And reveal themselves to you only if they have your mark.

&amp;#x200B;

([The components](https://rolltoreview.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/argent-the-consortium-lvl-99-games-review-components-2.jpg?w=794&amp;h=719))

&amp;#x200B;

You  start the game with one mark already on the board, but throughout the  game you get chances to place more. Until you place all twelve, you  never know where you stand and how close you are to the chancellery.  This creates a level of uncertainty between you and the other  applicants. As everyone starts the game with a different piece of  information, you need to try and guess what they saw, or spend a turn to  place a mark and confirm it.

&amp;#x200B;

This  doubt makes you feel like you’re all stumbling in a dark room together.  However, the game never gets that aimless. As you’re constantly growing  more and more powerful, regardless of if you’re closer to winning.

&amp;#x200B;

This  feeling of doubt grows when you do draw a mark. As you’ll immediately  check the table for who’s winning it. And usually, it’s not you. This is  when human nature kicks you crotch, as even though you might be winning  several other marks – it’s the one you’re not winning that you’ll  concentrate on.

&amp;#x200B;

Because  of this you have this constant feeling of pressure and tension – you’re  never satisfied with what you have. But when you go after another  judge’s condition, it leaves the one’s you’ve previously been focusing  on open for competition. At that point you become a plate spinner,  trying to spin as many judges’ conditions as you can, while hoping no  one knocks you over at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s a great change from boring old victory points.

&amp;#x200B;

([The game after setup](https://rolltoreview.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/argent-the-consortium-lvl-99-games-review-table-hog.jpg?w=966&amp;h=725))

&amp;#x200B;

But let’s go back to the start.

&amp;#x200B;

You  begin with a waiting room of students looking for extra credit. On  every turn you can deploy one of these students to a building on campus,  this will net you rewards in the back-half of the round.

&amp;#x200B;

Right  now though, you need to figure out where to place who. As each student  is learned in a type of magic, and when placed they put their talents to  work. For instance, the red students wound mages already in the room –  sending them to the infirmary, meanwhile grey mages can be placed as an  extra action when you spend your turn casting a spell.

&amp;#x200B;

This  removes the delay between placement and feedback you often find in  worker placement games. Allowing the decision of placement to go beyond  the basic should I go here now, or later. Instead focusing on how best  to allocate your resources. Should you use your red dudes to take out an  opposition early? Or your green guys– immune to wounding – to take up  defensive positions? But if doing that means you won’t be able to cast  spells and place grey students?

&amp;#x200B;

It’s  this mechanic that should make you sit up straight in your chair right  now. The way Argent the Consortium blends its tactical and strategic  thinking together is what elevates the board game into a class of its  own.

&amp;#x200B;

([The minis](https://rolltoreview.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/argent-the-consortium-lvl-99-games-review-students.jpg?w=966&amp;h=725))

&amp;#x200B;

In the times you don’t want to place a worker down. You can instead use an item, supporter action, or a spell.

&amp;#x200B;

These  spells come from the different schools of magic. As such they are all  unique, and all insanely powerful. With some spells allowing you to take  multiple turns, others can send everyone in a packed room to the  infirmary. Each spell can also be leveled up twice more, growing  exponentially more powerful. Giving you the same feeling as a level 1,  level 50, level 100 character from a mobile game advert.

&amp;#x200B;

While  each game you’re guaranteed to get a spell, they cost a lot to cast,  and even more to level up. However, when you do, you’ll be able to  control the board in ways that would feel broken in other games but  feels right at home here. Making for some crazy turns that stick in your  memory a long time after the game is done.

&amp;#x200B;

The  last action you can perform is taking a bell tower card. These cards  give you a bonus for the round. When you pick up the last bell tower  card, the round is over.

&amp;#x200B;

You  and the other candidates can use this mechanic to play with the pace of  the round as though it were the last pea on your plate. Sometimes  you’ll have a slow war of attrition, whereby you’ll try and use each  worker as efficiently as possible. Other times, you’ll use speedy mages  to flood the board as quick as you can. It's yet another mechanism that  builds strategy and tactics into the game. With very little overhead.

&amp;#x200B;

Once  the last bell tower has been picked up, each room, and each worker in  the room is activated in turn. And you gain the bonus of the space that  they’re on. It’s now that you cross your fingers and toes and hope that  all your tactical warfare has led to a strategic advantage.

&amp;#x200B;

After  five rounds, the game stops, and you reveal each judge in a dramatic  fashion worthy of reality TV. Once all are revealed, you have your  winner.

&amp;#x200B;

([A character card](https://rolltoreview.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/img_20190604_213240.jpg?w=966&amp;h=725))

&amp;#x200B;

While this sounds and looks like a heavy game, it never feels like a heavy game.

&amp;#x200B;

Similarly,  to Spirit Island and Great Western Trail the complexity comes from the  decision space, not learning and internalising rules. Also like those  games it begins by constricting your moves, giving you time to  familiarise yourself with the rules before throwing you in the deep end.

&amp;#x200B;

The  beauty is even when you’re in that deep end and find out you can’t  swim, you can still flounder. And what I mean is that there are no bad  moves - just less efficient ones. Everything you do makes you more  powerful and feels meaningful. Even if no judge will praise you for it.

&amp;#x200B;

So  if you're looking for depth, Argent has plenty. And that’s before you  consider everything in the box. Every building tile is double sided with  different worker placement spots on either side. Likewise, the playable  characters. On top of that, there are more spells, items, and  supporters than you would ever need.

&amp;#x200B;

There is such an abundance of playable material, that you may never need another board game again.

&amp;#x200B;

Which is a huge compliment.

&amp;#x200B;

But  let me do one better. This game is special. It gets me excited just  thinking about getting it to the table again. So much so, that in  writing this review I got so excited that I bought the expansion. That’s  never happened before. Argent the Consortium is absolutely in the top 4  games I’ve ever played.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After  five rounds, the game stops, and you reveal each judge in a dramatic  fashion worthy of reality TV. Once all are revealed, you have your  winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://rolltoreview.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/img_20190604_213240.jpg?w=966&amp;amp;h=725""&gt;A character card&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this sounds and looks like a heavy game, it never feels like a heavy game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly,  to Spirit Island and Great Western Trail the complexity comes from the  decision space, not learning and internalising rules. Also like those  games it begins by constricting your moves, giving you time to  familiarise yourself with the rules before throwing you in the deep end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The  beauty is even when you’re in that deep end and find out you can’t  swim, you can still flounder. And what I mean is that there are no bad  moves - just less efficient ones. Everything you do makes you more  powerful and feels meaningful. Even if no judge will praise you for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So  if you&amp;#39;re looking for depth, Argent has plenty. And that’s before you  consider everything in the box. Every building tile is double sided with  different worker placement spots on either side. Likewise, the playable  characters. On top of that, there are more spells, items, and  supporters than you would ever need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is such an abundance of playable material, that you may never need another board game again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is a huge compliment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But  let me do one better. This game is special. It gets me excited just  thinking about getting it to the table again. So much so, that in  writing this review I got so excited that I bought the expansion. That’s  never happened before. Argent the Consortium is absolutely in the top 4  games I’ve ever played.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://rolltoreview.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/argent-the-consortium-lvl-99-games-review-corgi.jpg?w=966&amp;amp;h=725""&gt;And here&amp;#39;s my dog&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

I’m Frank West, designer of The Isle of Cats, The City of Kings, and Vadoran Gardens. I run a small board game publishing company in England called The City of Games, and I also organise a 400-person annual convention in Bristol.

I would be happy to answer any questions you have about my games and designing games within a single world. But I would also love to discuss game design, starting a publishing company, finances, marketing, Kickstarters, organising conventions, and pretty much anything you might want to know!

My philosophy is to always be open an honest, so if there is anything you’ve ever wanted to ask, I’ll do my best to answer.

If you would like to continue the discussion after the AMA, please feel free to join me on [The Isle of Cats Kickstarter page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tcokgame/the-isle-of-cats?ref=bmy8my).

Edit. It's been 7 hours since I made the post and I think it's nearly time for bed, thank you so much to everyone who has come and asked questions today, it's been great!

&lt;p&gt;I’m Frank West, designer of The Isle of Cats, The City of Kings, and Vadoran Gardens. I run a small board game publishing company in England called The City of Games, and I also organise a 400-person annual convention in Bristol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be happy to answer any questions you have about my games and designing games within a single world. But I would also love to discuss game design, starting a publishing company, finances, marketing, Kickstarters, organising conventions, and pretty much anything you might want to know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My philosophy is to always be open an honest, so if there is anything you’ve ever wanted to ask, I’ll do my best to answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to continue the discussion after the AMA, please feel free to join me on &lt;a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tcokgame/the-isle-of-cats?ref=bmy8my""&gt;The Isle of Cats Kickstarter page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

173,,boardgames,"Hello, friend and I are playing War of the Ring for the first time and we have reached an impasse. We can't figure out whether combat cards or companion abilities come first. In our specific example, Gandalf the White has an ability that negates the leadership of the Nazgul. Meanwhile, shadow player has a combat card that gives bonuses based off of the Nazgul's leadership capability.  
  
So in this example, Player A chooses a combat card that gives bonuses to his units based on Nazgul leadership. The other player, then activates Gandalf's ability that erases all of Nazguls leadership points, which affects not only the combat itself, but nullifies the card that was just played. Is this how it should happen? Or do companions have a window in which they must declare their special ability? This step is not mentioned in any of the battle phase resolutions. Is the companion's special ability always active no matter what?

174,,boardgames,"Hi all, I recently read (can't remember exactly where) about someone who likes to use a very short board game to replace an aspect of a different game. Also found out that the Century Spice Road games can be combined into one bigger game.

So my question is this - what interesting and creative ways can you all think of to combine multiple board games into one longer, epic game?

Examples I can think of off the top of my head:

1. When you are supposed to ""Go to Jail"" in **Monopoly**, instead play a game of **Whitehall Mystery** as the criminal and only go to jail if you get caught.
2. In **Cosmic Encounter**, convert the ship totals + encounter card values to ship points values and play a round of **X-Wing Miniatures Game** to decide the combat
3. When you need to gather wood/food in **Robinson Crusoe**, instead of rolling the die that tells you if you succeeded play a game of **Click Clack Lumberjack** or **Let's Go Fishing!** and only take the resource if you manage to get a certain number of bark/fish

Champions of Midgard is a middleweight, Viking-themed, worker placement game with dice rolling in which players are leaders of Viking clans who have traveled to an embattled Viking harbor town to help defend it against the threat of trolls, draugr, and other mythological Norse beasts. By defeating these epic creatures, players gain glory and the favor of the gods. When the game ends, the player who has earned the most glory earns the title of Jarl and is recognized as a champion of Midgard!

Placing workers allows for the collection of resources and warriors, which players may then send on journeys to neighboring villages or across the sea to defeat monsters and gain the glory they need for victory. Resources are used to carve runes, build ships, and feed your followers. Viking warriors (custom dice) do battle with the myriad enemies the town faces.

185,,boardgames,"So I was fortunate enough to catch this game during its second Kickstarter run and went all in for the expansions and everything. And I’m so glad I did. I have recently found the time to dedicate to this game properly and have been making my way through the *curse scenarios.* It has been an absolute blast of an experience and I can’t wait to play more. 
This game is kind of a slow burn. It’s not face paced, intense action or combat. It is interactive story telling reminiscent of when I read choose your own adventure books as a kid, which is exactly what they were going for. The exploration in this game is so much fun. Every time I get to a new tile, there’s so much I can do. And each choice usually is followed by another either/or decision that can have beneficial or damning consequences. I can craft equipment to help me along, but doing so might eventually cost me unless I’m being smart about how I use my resources. Each gamble I take on following a new path could ultimately leave me sick, hurt, or worse, dead. But the payoff is worth it when I’m rewarded with life-saving medicine, or a weapon to combat danger, or that ever important flame to keep hope alive. 
The game just tells the narrative so well with such little information presented on the board. Each section of terrain usually has a small piece of story attached to it, with each action also furthering the storyline as your progress. Plus, there’s so many different expansions now that this will have me entertained for a long time trying to get through each one. Granted, I’m sure there will be some slight overlap in cards because after all, there is a finite number in the game of certain options, however the way it is crafted, I doubt this will matter much as the way in which the situation presents will be completely different from any time it has presented before due to circumstance, progression, and game state. 
The only downside I could see is replay ability eventually running out or growing slightly stale. The first play through everything is new and there’s so many options to explore, you can’t possibly hope to hit all of them. Even if you decide to play through the same story a second and third time I could see it playing out differently because of card mechanics and choices. Eventually, however, it will exhaust itself to where you know all the results and by that point, I will have gotten my money’s worth several times over and I’ll only be too happy to part with the game to let someone else enjoy it for the first time. 
Group play is great, but it can get a little mucked up because there isn’t really a turn order dynamic and so quarterback or dominant players can often times take over or steamroll decisions, but if you have a solid play group that can work together, the game is a blast to explore with a group. However, solo it definitely shines. It’s one of those games in my collection where when I have a spare hour or two, I can break it out and just enjoy working through the story and seeing where it takes me. The *Save* mechanic that the game incorporates for keeping track of progress as well as easy break down and setup is great. It also becomes part of the story, in which there will be cases where you’ll have to rest and save in order to trigger certain events and replenish certain resources. It’s all just brilliantly designed. 
So I just cannot sing the praises of this game enough. I know it’s a little tough to find, but if you manage to get your hands on a copy or have the chance to, I highly recommend checking it out as it is an incredible narrative gaming experience. 

Plus, the company is so awesome that due to a printing hiccup the first time around, some of the card sizes were misprinted/miscut, and the company resent the proper sized cards to replace the initial run, free of charge. I’m sure that wasn’t cheap, but it was greatly appreciated. The customer service is top notch. I had the pleasure of meeting the designers/creators at GenCon50, who walked me through a play through of the game and were extremely nice, personable, and passionate. They also have a Kickstarter I think coming next year for their next entry in the choose your own adventure style gameplay called 7th Citadel I think? I’ll definitely be on board day 1 of that as well. 

**tl;dr / in summary:** The 7th Continent is an amazing gameplay experience and I highly recommend it. It plays incredibly well solo and also is fun in a group setting. If you can find a copy, I cannot recommend enough that you get you pick it up. If you like this type of interactive narrative game, I don’t see how you could be disappointed. It’s definitely in my top 5 favorite games of all time, with its only downside being replayability is eventually spoiled by knowing what’s going to happen next, when the surprise is gone.",t2_az4tu,False,,0,False,"If you’re looking for a great solo or group cooperative game, I can not recommend The 7th Continent enough.","[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Review'}]",r/boardgames,False,6,review,0,,False,t3_cbwrdc,False,dark,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Review,False,1,,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1562886896.0,richtext,6,,text,self.boardgames,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I was fortunate enough to catch this game during its second Kickstarter run and went all in for the expansions and everything.

188,,boardgames,"Hi Guys, 
So I have been into board-gaming for over a year now, and like most people, it wasn’t long into my plunge that I came across the world of Kickstarter games. 

I am a backer on one game. And thus the SHOCK!!! 
I know this is common knowledge by now, but how it is okay that it has become a norm to deliver KS games 3/6 months late? 

I may sound critical here, but I am not actually that kind of person. Like I understand there can be unfortunate events out of the publishers control. But that’s different to what appears to me to be a norm where people order games expecting them to be late, not by a month but by 3 months or more. 

Like I have backed Eclipse: 2nd Dawn, and I was one of the many backers new the this world who wondered why it wasn’t coming when they said it would. I was shocked to find threads on BGG of new backers rightfully upset, and and older veterans comforting the newer guys by saying that MOST KS projects are in-fact 3/4 months late. 

And again, I realize that KS is for bringing projects to life that wouldn’t otherwise be viable. And so if KS had one or two board-gaming projects and these were late, then that would be totally understandable. But you would think after having been a platform for thousands of games that publishers would have come to a realistic knowledge of how long a given game will take. And yet this isn’t the case. 

So my question is, isn’t this at some point a lie to the customer, making us believe it will come in March, when actually they really know that’s unrealistic and it will actually only come in August?  Why can’t they just be more honest with the expectations they create? 

I am still very excited about my game, and I am probably going to back another game on KS, but it feels good get this off my chest.

Game has a lot of miniatures and good quality ones are expensive and the current amount being pledged likely woulddnt be enough to cover it.

218,,boardgames,"Most of my board game time in the past 10 years has been 2-player with my wife. Once we were introduced to Pandemic, co-op games have been our bread and butter. We'll mix in the occasional game of Terraforming Mars or Concordia, but co-op games seem to be the ideal game for many couples - and we fit that mold. We've had a lot of enjoyment lately playing co-op deck builders in particular, so I thought I'd share what we've learned so far. I'll talk about these games roughly from least to most favorite. There are a couple of games in this list that might not fit the definition exactly, but this is my post, so I'll do what I want.

First up is **Shadowrun: Crossfire** (10 plays). This game has the structure of a great deck builder, but fails in the execution. I really liked the theme - the mix of futuristic tech and magic was very cool (I understand there is a Shadowrun universe, but I know nothing about it). The game had some neat little elements - a campaign like structure where you can earn perks to make your character stronger, which allows you to attempt harder missions.

It's failings were critical for us, however. Lots of co-op games are swingy because of card draw, but S:C pretty much takes the cake. You can have insta-lose right away due to bad card draw, or you can feel good about yourself and then get massacred in one turn. I like my co-ops hard, but reasonably so - I don't want to have to grind out the same mission over and over to gain perks. It's a board game, not a video game.

*You might like this if*: you like losing a lot, you love the Shadowrun universe, insta-lose is your friend.

**Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle** (20 plays) is an interesting one. This game is the best bad game I've every played. As a family of Harry Potter fanatics, buying this game was a no-brainer, but my expectations were low. Once we got into it, we found numerous things that we loved, and just as many that we hated. Essentially, it is a great game that is fundamentally broken. You can read [my specific thoughts here](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8bqqyz/harry_potter_hogwarts_battle_is_the_best_bad_game/), but to sum up: 1. Poor player count scaling, 2. No categories/tiers of villains or cards, 3. The Spiral of Death.

But on the plus side, it's got some really good mechanics that incorporate everything you love from the Harry Potter universe. (If you're interested, here's a link to my [post about house rules for the game](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8bziei/harry_potter_hogwarts_battle_house_rules/).)

*You might like this if*: you love Harry Potter.

**Shadowrift** (5 plays), is my newest find in the co-op deck builder category. You should take my comments with a grain of salt because A) I've only played 5 times, and B) There is a revised 2nd Edition I've never seen (I acquired a 1st edition copy). In this game you are heroes defending a town from invading monsters, who apparently are coming in through a rift. You can win by either building walls around the town, or sealing the rifts. There are a couple of clever mechanics in this game, notably the Town and Traveler cards. Instead of just having a town with health points, you are actually constructing a deck of townspeople by hiring villagers to join the town. On your turn, you can use the abilities of the townsfolk to assist you in your fight. However, when the monsters kill someone in the town, they are replaced by Corpses, which (as you may guess) aren't great.

It's a neat take on the genre, and I like the decision space it provides for you. There is a variable market of cards to buy from, and the base game comes with 5 (6?) enemies to fight. Overall, it's an entertaining game with more good than bad.

The biggest issue I've had with the game is that you mix one Shadowrift per player into the monster deck of 20 cards. When those pop up makes a huge difference in winning. Too early and the game is a cake walk, too late and you might not survive. But compared to some of the other games, that issue isn't a game breaker.

I would absolutely recommend trying to grab a copy in a trade on the cheap (heck, there's even a [copy available for $1 plus shipping](https://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/product/1880465) right now). I understand that there's a 2nd Edition with expansions and more content, but the price tag seems high to me. I'm expecting to get 20+ plays out of it and then move it in a trade. I don't see it as a long term game without more content.

*You might like this if*: you want to play around with an interesting shared deck mechanic, you like trying out fun new games that won't take over your life

Well, speaking of taking over your life, let's talk about **Legendary: Marvel** (10 plays). I'm just going to lump all the flavors of Legendary together and call them Legendary: Marvel. There is a huge amount of content in the Legendary game universe, so you can explore it as deeply as you wish. Essentially every game you have a starting hand, there is a random market of cards, there are villains, and there's a big bad to fight. Every fight is slightly different due to the various mechanics brought to the table by your setup. Every game I've played of this has been enjoyable but not spectacular. In general it's a well tuned system that feels just a bit too sterile to me.

My friend owns lots of content for this game, and we always joke that playing Legendary is 3 games in 1. Game 1: Assemble the cards, Game 2: Play the game, Game 3: Sort all the cards and put everything away again.

Now, before you yell at me that **Sentinels of the Multiverse** (12 plays) isn't a deck builder, let me just say this: You're correct. However, it feels so much like these other games that I feel it is legal to include this in the list. If you are looking for a co-op deck builder to play, SotM might be the game you love. Sentinels has a few amazing things going for it, and one big downside. The positives first: Awesome theme - just a wonderful comic book world that you get to play in. Great decks - instead of building a deck as you go, each hero has their own pre-constructed deck. And boy does each deck play differently. You get a real sense of how each hero is a different character by what they can do with their cards. Super quick to set up - grab hero decks, bad guy deck, environment deck, and your tokens. Bam! Ready to play.

Did I say ""tokens""? Ah, yes, to the negative - saying that Sentinels is a bit fiddly is like saying Campaign for North Africa runs a bit long. I'm getting ready to attack and I have a +1 Damage token on my guy, and there's another +1 Damage token ... is that for me, or only when attacking the Environment? Wait, why is that +1 Damage Taken token there? Did the card that brought that into play get discarded or not? What type of damage did he do? Am I immune to fire or not?

It's not insurmountable, and it definitely gets easier with multiple plays, but managing the tokens and health is a barrier to enjoying the game. If that sounds frustrating, don't even try this game. But if you can get over that hurdle, Sentinels offers some truly great experiences with very fun, thematic cards.

*You might like this if*: you like superheroes, cool combos, and are fine with fiddly mechanics

So, you thought I was cheating with Sentinels? How about this - my next game is **Orleans: Invasion** (20 plays), a game that doesn't even have cards! Before you string me up by my meeples, hear me out: Orleans is a bag builder, and a bag builder is simply a modified deck builder. I'm including it because I find this game definitely scratches some of the same itches of the other games on this list. You're working together, building up an engine, trying to beat the Big Bad.

In order to play the cooperative version of Orleans, you need the base game plus The Invasion expansion. On the one hand, that's a relatively big investment; on the other hand, you also have the exceptional base game of Orleans to play. The Invasion expansion does a masterful job of turning a purely competitive game into a cooperative experience. Each player gets their own role which requires them to achieve different goals along with the group goals. The roles change every game, and the random events change, so the puzzle is different every time. Difficulty can easily be scaled up or down. We have had numerous games that came down to the last turn, which is exactly what I want in a co-op.

*You might like this if*: you like bag building, you like Orleans

I'm saving the best for last, so it's time for **Aeon's End** (150+ plays). I won't deny that I'm a fanboy. Aeon's End has marched all the way up to be my #1 favorite game of all time. I own all content, and backed the latest Kickstarter. So at least you know where I'm coming from here.

In Aeon's End, you play mages who are trying to defend Gravehold from an attacking Nemesis. The primary strength of AE is the incredible variability you get with the different types of Mages, Nemeses, and market cards. Every game feels unique and different - a mage that might work well against one Nemesis could fall flat against a different one. My wife and I like to do a completely randomized setup, and then tweak it if we end up in a battle we can't win.

Mechanically, Aeon's End is a finely tuned machine. The vast majority of the games we've played have been entertaining and close. You feel like you're getting stronger, which is good because you know the minions get stronger as well. The Nemesis deck is built in tiers. Each Nemesis has their own unique cards, and those are mixed in with a random collection of basic cards. These are stacked with the easiest tier on top. The criticism could be: ""It takes longer to set up."" However, I will take a slightly longer setup time that gives me a better overall experience instead of the insta-lose games you can have with HP:HB or Shadowrun. And you are rarely put in a no-win situation. Even games where we lose in the mid-game are winnable with a strategy change. Most of the time we just reset the game and give it another go.

And, Aeon's End is simply cool. You have to open breaches to create more space to play more spells. You choose between gems, relics, and spells to buy to get the perfect deck. You can also charge up the special ability that only your mage has. The pace, flow, and feel of the game just sing for me. (Important note: I vastly prefer AE at 2P over 3 or 4. I just feel you get more powerful and can do more cool things at the lower player count.)

Finally, there are two important mechanics to mention. 1. A deck builder with no shuffling. It's a cool thing, because this game expects you to pack your discard pile to get powerful combos. It adds interesting decisions on when to buy a card, or when to hold cards in your hand for the next turn. 2. Variable turn order. At 2P, everybody (each mage and the Nemesis) get 2 turn order cards. Those 6 cards are shuffled and flipped to determine who goes when. It makes a procedural game more dynamic. This brings up another common complaint of AE: ""You can win or lose depending on how the turn order deck was shuffled!"" Often times that's true, but I love it - and if you end up losing, there was probably something better you could have done earlier to put yourself in a better position.

So there we go. Way too much text about co-op deckbuilders. I'd love to hear if anybody has other games they've played and would recommend. I've got a couple on my Want in Trade list, so hopefully they'll make it to my table at some point.",t2_cb5nt,False,,0,False,"Cooperative Deck Builders - The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly",[],r/boardgames,False,6,,0,,False,t3_cb2s9i,False,dark,,public,687,0,{},,c63d6e78-18aa-11e7-9922-0ef608c792b0,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,687,,self,False,gloomhaven,"[{'e': 'text', 't': ""Aeon's End""}]",{},,True,,1562716949.0,text,6,,richtext,self.boardgames,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of my board game time in the past 10 years has been 2-player with my wife. Once we were introduced to Pandemic, co-op games have been our bread and butter. We&amp;#39;ll mix in the occasional game of Terraforming Mars or Concordia, but co-op games seem to be the ideal game for many couples - and we fit that mold. We&amp;#39;ve had a lot of enjoyment lately playing co-op deck builders in particular, so I thought I&amp;#39;d share what we&amp;#39;ve learned so far. I&amp;#39;ll talk about these games roughly from least to most favorite. There are a couple of games in this list that might not fit the definition exactly, but this is my post, so I&amp;#39;ll do what I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up is &lt;strong&gt;Shadowrun: Crossfire&lt;/strong&gt; (10 plays). This game has the structure of a great deck builder, but fails in the execution. I really liked the theme - the mix of futuristic tech and magic was very cool (I understand there is a Shadowrun universe, but I know nothing about it). The game had some neat little elements - a campaign like structure where you can earn perks to make your character stronger, which allows you to attempt harder missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s failings were critical for us, however. Lots of co-op games are swingy because of card draw, but S:C pretty much takes the cake. You can have insta-lose right away due to bad card draw, or you can feel good about yourself and then get massacred in one turn. I like my co-ops hard, but reasonably so - I don&amp;#39;t want to have to grind out the same mission over and over to gain perks. It&amp;#39;s a board game, not a video game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You might like this if&lt;/em&gt;: you like losing a lot, you love the Shadowrun universe, insta-lose is your friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle&lt;/strong&gt; (20 plays) is an interesting one. This game is the best bad game I&amp;#39;ve every played. As a family of Harry Potter fanatics, buying this game was a no-brainer, but my expectations were low. Once we got into it, we found numerous things that we loved, and just as many that we hated. Essentially, it is a great game that is fundamentally broken. You can read &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8bqqyz/harry_potter_hogwarts_battle_is_the_best_bad_game/""&gt;my specific thoughts here&lt;/a&gt;, but to sum up: 1. Poor player count scaling, 2. No categories/tiers of villains or cards, 3. The Spiral of Death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on the plus side, it&amp;#39;s got some really good mechanics that incorporate everything you love from the Harry Potter universe. (If you&amp;#39;re interested, here&amp;#39;s a link to my &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8bziei/harry_potter_hogwarts_battle_house_rules/""&gt;post about house rules for the game&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You might like this if&lt;/em&gt;: you love Harry Potter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shadowrift&lt;/strong&gt; (5 plays), is my newest find in the co-op deck builder category. You should take my comments with a grain of salt because A) I&amp;#39;ve only played 5 times, and B) There is a revised 2nd Edition I&amp;#39;ve never seen (I acquired a 1st edition copy). In this game you are heroes defending a town from invading monsters, who apparently are coming in through a rift. You can win by either building walls around the town, or sealing the rifts. There are a couple of clever mechanics in this game, notably the Town and Traveler cards. Instead of just having a town with health points, you are actually constructing a deck of townspeople by hiring villagers to join the town. On your turn, you can use the abilities of the townsfolk to assist you in your fight. However, when the monsters kill someone in the town, they are replaced by Corpses, which (as you may guess) aren&amp;#39;t great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a neat take on the genre, and I like the decision space it provides for you. There is a variable market of cards to buy from, and the base game comes with 5 (6?) enemies to fight. Overall, it&amp;#39;s an entertaining game with more good than bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue I&amp;#39;ve had with the game is that you mix one Shadowrift per player into the monster deck of 20 cards. When those pop up makes a huge difference in winning. Too early and the game is a cake walk, too late and you might not survive. But compared to some of the other games, that issue isn&amp;#39;t a game breaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would absolutely recommend trying to grab a copy in a trade on the cheap (heck, there&amp;#39;s even a &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/product/1880465""&gt;copy available for $1 plus shipping&lt;/a&gt; right now). I understand that there&amp;#39;s a 2nd Edition with expansions and more content, but the price tag seems high to me. I&amp;#39;m expecting to get 20+ plays out of it and then move it in a trade. I don&amp;#39;t see it as a long term game without more content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You might like this if&lt;/em&gt;: you want to play around with an interesting shared deck mechanic, you like trying out fun new games that won&amp;#39;t take over your life&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, speaking of taking over your life, let&amp;#39;s talk about &lt;strong&gt;Legendary: Marvel&lt;/strong&gt; (10 plays). I&amp;#39;m just going to lump all the flavors of Legendary together and call them Legendary: Marvel. There is a huge amount of content in the Legendary game universe, so you can explore it as deeply as you wish. Essentially every game you have a starting hand, there is a random market of cards, there are villains, and there&amp;#39;s a big bad to fight. Every fight is slightly different due to the various mechanics brought to the table by your setup. Every game I&amp;#39;ve played of this has been enjoyable but not spectacular. In general it&amp;#39;s a well tuned system that feels just a bit too sterile to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend owns lots of content for this game, and we always joke that playing Legendary is 3 games in 1. Game 1: Assemble the cards, Game 2: Play the game, Game 3: Sort all the cards and put everything away again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You might like this if&lt;/em&gt;: you love the IP, you have an organization fetish&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, before you yell at me that &lt;strong&gt;Sentinels of the Multiverse&lt;/strong&gt; (12 plays) isn&amp;#39;t a deck builder, let me just say this: You&amp;#39;re correct. However, it feels so much like these other games that I feel it is legal to include this in the list. If you are looking for a co-op deck builder to play, SotM might be the game you love. Sentinels has a few amazing things going for it, and one big downside. The positives first: Awesome theme - just a wonderful comic book world that you get to play in. Great decks - instead of building a deck as you go, each hero has their own pre-constructed deck. And boy does each deck play differently. You get a real sense of how each hero is a different character by what they can do with their cards. Super quick to set up - grab hero decks, bad guy deck, environment deck, and your tokens. Bam! Ready to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I say &amp;quot;tokens&amp;quot;? Ah, yes, to the negative - saying that Sentinels is a bit fiddly is like saying Campaign for North Africa runs a bit long. I&amp;#39;m getting ready to attack and I have a +1 Damage token on my guy, and there&amp;#39;s another +1 Damage token ... is that for me, or only when attacking the Environment? Wait, why is that +1 Damage Taken token there? Did the card that brought that into play get discarded or not? What type of damage did he do? Am I immune to fire or not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not insurmountable, and it definitely gets easier with multiple plays, but managing the tokens and health is a barrier to enjoying the game. If that sounds frustrating, don&amp;#39;t even try this game. But if you can get over that hurdle, Sentinels offers some truly great experiences with very fun, thematic cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You might like this if&lt;/em&gt;: you like superheroes, cool combos, and are fine with fiddly mechanics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you thought I was cheating with Sentinels? How about this - my next game is &lt;strong&gt;Orleans: Invasion&lt;/strong&gt; (20 plays), a game that doesn&amp;#39;t even have cards! Before you string me up by my meeples, hear me out: Orleans is a bag builder, and a bag builder is simply a modified deck builder. I&amp;#39;m including it because I find this game definitely scratches some of the same itches of the other games on this list. You&amp;#39;re working together, building up an engine, trying to beat the Big Bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to play the cooperative version of Orleans, you need the base game plus The Invasion expansion. On the one hand, that&amp;#39;s a relatively big investment; on the other hand, you also have the exceptional base game of Orleans to play. The Invasion expansion does a masterful job of turning a purely competitive game into a cooperative experience. Each player gets their own role which requires them to achieve different goals along with the group goals. The roles change every game, and the random events change, so the puzzle is different every time. Difficulty can easily be scaled up or down. We have had numerous games that came down to the last turn, which is exactly what I want in a co-op.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You might like this if&lt;/em&gt;: you like bag building, you like Orleans&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m saving the best for last, so it&amp;#39;s time for &lt;strong&gt;Aeon&amp;#39;s End&lt;/strong&gt; (150+ plays). I won&amp;#39;t deny that I&amp;#39;m a fanboy. Aeon&amp;#39;s End has marched all the way up to be my #1 favorite game of all time. I own all content, and backed the latest Kickstarter. So at least you know where I&amp;#39;m coming from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Aeon&amp;#39;s End, you play mages who are trying to defend Gravehold from an attacking Nemesis. The primary strength of AE is the incredible variability you get with the different types of Mages, Nemeses, and market cards. Every game feels unique and different - a mage that might work well against one Nemesis could fall flat against a different one. My wife and I like to do a completely randomized setup, and then tweak it if we end up in a battle we can&amp;#39;t win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanically, Aeon&amp;#39;s End is a finely tuned machine. The vast majority of the games we&amp;#39;ve played have been entertaining and close. You feel like you&amp;#39;re getting stronger, which is good because you know the minions get stronger as well. The Nemesis deck is built in tiers. Each Nemesis has their own unique cards, and those are mixed in with a random collection of basic cards. These are stacked with the easiest tier on top. The criticism could be: &amp;quot;It takes longer to set up.&amp;quot; However, I will take a slightly longer setup time that gives me a better overall experience instead of the insta-lose games you can have with HP:HB or Shadowrun. And you are rarely put in a no-win situation. Even games where we lose in the mid-game are winnable with a strategy change. Most of the time we just reset the game and give it another go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, Aeon&amp;#39;s End is simply cool. You have to open breaches to create more space to play more spells. You choose between gems, relics, and spells to buy to get the perfect deck. You can also charge up the special ability that only your mage has. The pace, flow, and feel of the game just sing for me. (Important note: I vastly prefer AE at 2P over 3 or 4. I just feel you get more powerful and can do more cool things at the lower player count.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are two important mechanics to mention. 1. A deck builder with no shuffling. It&amp;#39;s a cool thing, because this game expects you to pack your discard pile to get powerful combos. It adds interesting decisions on when to buy a card, or when to hold cards in your hand for the next turn. 2. Variable turn order. At 2P, everybody (each mage and the Nemesis) get 2 turn order cards. Those 6 cards are shuffled and flipped to determine who goes when. It makes a procedural game more dynamic. This brings up another common complaint of AE: &amp;quot;You can win or lose depending on how the turn order deck was shuffled!&amp;quot; Often times that&amp;#39;s true, but I love it - and if you end up losing, there was probably something better you could have done earlier to put yourself in a better position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there we go. Way too much text about co-op deckbuilders. I&amp;#39;d love to hear if anybody has other games they&amp;#39;ve played and would recommend. I&amp;#39;ve got a couple on my Want in Trade list, so hopefully they&amp;#39;ll make it to my table at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

231,,boardgames,"Many of you liked my first diary entry, so I continue today.

Here a link to the days 1 - 5:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c9l5wd/developer\_diary\_for\_werewolf\_vs\_vampire/](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c9l5wd/developer_diary_for_werewolf_vs_vampire/)

&amp;#x200B;

## Day 6

What does an **offer** look like?

After I have obtained offers from various companies worldwide, I would like to show here how an offer is structured.

&amp;#x200B;

Excel seems to be the standard, even if it is sometimes converted into a PDF for mailing.

The indicated prices are mostly in dollars, so that I have converted these for comparison to European manufacturers.

&amp;#x200B;

There are different columns in the offer:

**Name**

This is the name of the component, which I had assigned during the inquiry.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dimensions**

The dimensions are either in millimeters or in inches. But always mentioned behind it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Printing Process**/**Color/Finish**

Here there is usually something like 4/4c. Means number of colors front side / number of colors back side. If it is colorful, there is always 4c there, with black strangely mostly 0c. But this means apparently ""no further printing"". In addition, there are other properties under Finish, such as ""rollable"", ""sealed in plastic bag"", ""hot stamping"".

&amp;#x200B;

**Quantity**

If, for example, 10 cubes are ordered and only differ in colour, then here is ""10"" and under colour the division.

&amp;#x200B;

**Material**/**Construction**/**Mould Charge**/**Film Charge**

This is the specification of what the material is made of or special features of the material. For example: CCNB - "" Clay coated news back board (CCNB) Recycled paperboard that is not bleached, has a white on 1 side that has been clay coated and the other side of the sheet is gray like a newspaper"". I found a good page that explains the abbreviations ([https://howtobuypackaging.com/packaging-industry-terminology/](https://howtobuypackaging.com/packaging-industry-terminology/)).

&amp;#x200B;

**Reference Image**

Often there is even an image in this column. Mostly my pictures, which I had sent along. Sometimes I had to be careful, because the dice were very similar, but those that the manufacturer still had in stock.

&amp;#x200B;

**Unit cost**

Typically, you can also see here which reference quantity this applies to (that is, 500 or 1000). If there are ""10 dice"" in the column, then the price is for ""10 dice"" and not just for one.

&amp;#x200B;

**Development cost**/**tooling cost**

I explained this yesterday with the dice. If a machine has to be set up for mass production or even parts have to be created for it, these are the costs. These are one-time setup costs.

&amp;#x200B;

At the bottom is the **total cost** of a game and the **total setup costs**. For example: 1 game costs 15 Euros in production and a total of 500 Euros in setup costs. If you break the setup costs down to the games, then the single game costs 16 Euro for 500 games and therefore all together 8.000 Euro.

&amp;#x200B;

There are also some special rows like **Assembly Cost** and **FOBNingbo**. But I'll explain tomorrow more about these and what the offer must cover about **CE** (European must have tests).

## Day 7

To continue my report from yesterday, I want to explain two more columns and what should be included in the offer about CE, testing and shipping.

&amp;#x200B;

**Assembly Cost**

My game consists of 11 different items (so the 10 wooden discs count as 1 item). These still have to be packed together and then the game has to be shrink-wrapped. All this costs time and material. With my inquiries this was always about 50 cents.

&amp;#x200B;

**FOBxxx**

There is always a harbour for xxx. FOB means Free On Board and is like CIF an international shipping agreement. FOB means as much as: We load the goods, but everything else is in your hands. That means transport, customs and further transport. (Detailed here: [https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/020215/what-difference-between-cif-and-fob.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/020215/what-difference-between-cif-and-fob.asp))

&amp;#x200B;

**Shipping Cost**

Ask about shipping cost, and if shipping, unloading and customs clearance are included.

&amp;#x200B;

**CE**

For Europe the offer should state that the goods are CE compliant. That way there is one less worry for you about the CE seal. There are very good webpages about CE.

## Day 8

Finally something to work on. I got the template for the playing cards today and am already busy filling them.

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed three terms:

**Margin** (Type)

Everything that is important to me should be within this innermost frame. Otherwise, shifts can cause it to be cut off.

&amp;#x200B;

**Trim**

This represents the real size of the playing cards.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bleed**

Up to this point the card must be filled up, because otherwise it can happen that something would remain unprinted due to shifts.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, I noticed with the first card that my cards have a different format.

I chose the 'Skat' format and the template was in a wider format.

Now I've written to the manufacturer to ask what effect this might have.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also attached a picture to give you an idea of what measure means what.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the specification of what the material is made of or special features of the material. For example: CCNB - &amp;quot; Clay coated news back board (CCNB) Recycled paperboard that is not bleached, has a white on 1 side that has been clay coated and the other side of the sheet is gray like a newspaper&amp;quot;.

232,,boardgames,"The long awaited app version of the abstract strategy game Santorini, has gotten its public release!

At one point, the app was going to be free to play, with in app purchases. However, it's official release has transitioned to a base price of $4.99 with in-app purchases available.

[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Roxley.SantoriniGame)

[iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/santorini-board-game/id1456647343)

Edit: [Youtube preview](https://youtu.be/63bwRdbupec), a user on the [Santorini Board Game Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/santorinicommunity) page mentions that it is also live on the iOS store, but may take a few hours to show up.

Edit 2: The in game purchases appear to be various packs of the god cards. The base game includes 34 gods to choose from and god packs are $1.99 each, with a complete pantheon pack for $8.99

242,,boardgames,"Just played a round of Two Rooms and a Boom, and while I liked it as a party activity, imo it paled in strategy and deduction comparison to a game like Resistance. I felt the differences mainly came down to:

 * Strong symmetry - blues and reds equally want to hide their roles to the other team and share with their own. Compare to Resistance where the teams are unequal and one side must play very differently.
 * Even trades - for the most part you are sharing equal info with someone - it's a good move if they are on your side and it's a net-neutral move if they're not. So there isn't a strategic incentive to make moves (aside from speeding the game along)
 * Randomness and meta-gaming. It seems like a clear goal to get control and get President and Bomber in your room for the second-to-last round. But it felt like any configuration with President and Bomber separated is just 50/50 or relying on meta-gaming. Even if you have perfect information about all roles, you're just facing off with meta-strategies and hoping that the other room does not make a mirror move to ruin your plan.

Has anyone come up with home brew ways to improve the red vs blue strategy?

Happy Tuesday, /r/boardgames!

This is a weekly thread to discuss train games and 18xx games, which are a family of economic train games consisting of shared ownership in railroad companies. For more information, [see the description on BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/19/18xx). There’s also a subreddit devoted entirely to 18xx games, /r/18xx, and a subreddit devoted entirely to **[Age of Steam](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4098/age-steam)**, /r/AgeOfSteam.

Here’s a nice guide on [how to get started with 18xx](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/4sygx3/how_to_get_started_with_18xx/?st=iqny4loj&amp;sh=c01b5d88).

Feel free to discuss anything about train games, including recent plays, what you're looking forward to, and any questions you have. 

If you want to arrange to play some 18xx or other train games online, feel free to try to arrange a game with people via /r/playboardgames.

269,,boardgames,"Hey everybody !

I wanna buy one of these games because they both look great, however I can't decide which one I should buy.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like Rising Sun is a much ""heavier"" game, much more serious. I love the minis and the diplomatia aspect. However, I think it is harder to find people to play it, because you need a minimum of 3 players and 2h30\~. Price is also quite high (90€ here in France) but considering the quality of minis, it is understandable.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, I really love the idea of asymetric races in Root (much more impactful than in Rising Sun imo), and the gameplay seems much funnier. Also, you can play it with only 2 players + bot, which is very convenient. However, the game is pretty expansive (75€ in france for the base game + extension included), considering the materiel which looks pretty cheap (only some wooden pieces and a board), and the design is weird (mix between Dont Starve Together / children cartoon look). Also, I'm worried about the balance between races..

Could you give me your point of view please ? Could be a good help !

273,,boardgames,"**Quick backstory:**

&amp;#x200B;

In college (before I had ever played Catan) my friend got Puerto Rico as a gift, said it was supposed to be ""one of the best but most complicated board games ever"". This was 2007. No random chance? No dice? How could that work? We figured we'd have to take a day to learn the game, but we never did.

&amp;#x200B;

Cut to 2009, we're playing Catan like crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

Cut to 2010, we're playing Carcassonne and Ticket to Ride.

&amp;#x200B;

Cut to later in 2010, we think ""hey, maybe it's time to play Puerto Rico!""

&amp;#x200B;

We spend a day learning it and then play a 4 player game. It's so hard! What role do I choose? When does the game end, again? OMG so many buildings, which do I buy? DON'T CRAFTSMAN HE'LL GET 5 CORN! DID YOU BUILD THE FORTRESS I WANTED THE FORTRESS!

&amp;#x200B;

It took us HOURS.

&amp;#x200B;

It was too heavy for one of our friends but the rest of us liked the game a lot. It got played once or twice more with this group, and then hit the shelf for a long time. It was just too stressful of a game to bring out as much as TTR or Catan was.

&amp;#x200B;

Cut to 2011- 2019, most of those guys have moved away and the rest of us dive deep into board games. Dominion, Tzolk'in, Dominant Species. Twilight Struggle, all the Feld games, Cyclades, Kemet, Bohnanza, Eclipse, Dixit, Netrunner, Caylus, Codenames, it goes on and on (you know the drill). Puerto Rico got played once in 2016.

&amp;#x200B;

**And now...**

In case you didn't know, @gameylannister is a great dude on instagram trying to play the top 100 BGG games in 100 days. He needed to play Puerto Rico so we played a 3-player game over the weekend with my copy. We knocked it out in 90 minutes. I must be desensitized to ""heavy"" games now, or maybe games have gotten heavier over time, or maybe both, because PR felt like a challenging mid-weight game! This is particularly entertaining because of that game's history in my group of friends - as some crazy pie-in-the-sky game, and now just this medium ""let's have a beer in the afternoon"" game.

&amp;#x200B;

I know PR has fallen from favor due to its scripted opening and some balance issues, but it still provided a great challenge to us and meaningful decisions abound. I won 43-39-28 (don't remember the third score) and I don't know how good those scores are in terms of what's possible from the game. However, the other guys I was playing with are experienced gamers (just not with Puerto Rico) and had had no problem picking the game up immediately. Not overwhelmed by the choices or confused by any rules.

&amp;#x200B;

Just goes to show you how far the hobby has come.

274,,boardgames,"After planning for a couple weeks, my friends and I finally played a print-and-play version of Blood on the Clocktower (BOTC) that I had put together. Given the hullabaloo about the SUSD review earlier this year, I figured I'd pitch in with my take on the game.
A bit of background: My friends and I have played social deduction games, but it is definitely not our favorite genre by any means. We used to play The Resistance and One Night Ultimate Werewolf somewhat regularly, but those games fell out of fashion. In particular, we soured on The Resistance because there simply wasn’t enough actual information in the game to make it ‘interesting’. We now mostly play medium-ish games, some favorites being Ginkopolis, Inis, Not Alone, Scythe, Terraforming Mars, and Spirit Island. I mostly wanted to try BOTC due to the SUSD review – the idea of having that wonderful big group experience while still having logical, tactical deduction instead of shouting matches sounded wonderful.


Most people had played Mafia or Werewolf before, so explaining the rules was fairly simple. On the first game, the good characters cautiously shared information, while the evil players generally kept quiet and offered tentative alibis. It was only when the supposed monk realized that they were drunk did everyone go ‘wait, what?’ and the game started to shine. From there, the lies and deceptions started to flow much more naturally. We played another game right after with me storytelling, and another game with a new storyteller right after that. The new storyteller was able to pick up the role without too much effort, and we had a brilliant game of second guessing ourselves with a baron in play.


After the initial 3 plays, we then played the game 5 times with almost the same group the next day. Everyone got much more comfortable with the different roles and at bluffing, although one person did get slightly flustered at being the imp three times in a row. But it was the last game that truly sold it for our group. The demon was about to be killed through a smart deception from the ravenkeeper, but the spy successfully planted the idea that a poisoner could be about. Her words caused the good team to frantically analyze any possibility of their previous assumptions being wrong. We wavered over which outsider was in play for 10 minutes. The supposed recluse almost burst a blood vessel after we spent so much time considering if there was a drunk. It finally ended when we finally decided on killing the demon, the good team collapsing in a group hug when the storyteller announced that good had triumphed. We spent the next 30 minutes exhilarated and exhausted, going over all the craziness that had happened. It was the kind of high that any player of a social deduction game dreams of.


It’s a bit hard to explain what feels different between BOTC and its older cousins, but I think the biggest change is the lack of player elimination. Everyone can be involved for the whole game, and everyone *wants* to be involved for the whole game because they have their own unique role. This also means that the whole group is wrapped up in the dramatic tension at the end of the game – no one except the storyteller knows exactly what is going on. The game length varied a bit, but in general they were about 30 minutes all included with 7 players. The quick game length was definitely a plus overall, since most people got to experience different parts of the game with their different roles.


Overall, this is definitely my #1 social deduction game now. I loved the way I was not only always questioning other players, but also myself. Whenever I had a hunch about another player lying, I could reason out how that hunch could affect the given scenario. Victories and losses both felt very earned. I can’t wait to make printouts of the ‘Bad Moon Rising’ and ‘Violets and Sects’ modules, and I highly recommend anyone on the fence to print out a copy, grab a group, and try it for yourself. I’ll end by saying that I have never backed a kickstarter game before – and I hope to never do so again – but this is one game I really want to share with everyone I know and play it more.",t2_6ztdu,False,,0,False,Blood on the Clocktower Review,[],r/boardgames,False,6,,0,,False,t3_capmnx,False,dark,,public,138,1,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,138,,self,False,,[],{'gid_1': 1},,True,,1562642697.0,text,6,,text,self.boardgames,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;After planning for a couple weeks, my friends and I finally played a print-and-play version of Blood on the Clocktower (BOTC) that I had put together.

&lt;p&gt;Most people had played Mafia or Werewolf before, so explaining the rules was fairly simple. On the first game, the good characters cautiously shared information, while the evil players generally kept quiet and offered tentative alibis. It was only when the supposed monk realized that they were drunk did everyone go ‘wait, what?’ and the game started to shine. From there, the lies and deceptions started to flow much more naturally. We played another game right after with me storytelling, and another game with a new storyteller right after that. The new storyteller was able to pick up the role without too much effort, and we had a brilliant game of second guessing ourselves with a baron in play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the initial 3 plays, we then played the game 5 times with almost the same group the next day. Everyone got much more comfortable with the different roles and at bluffing, although one person did get slightly flustered at being the imp three times in a row. But it was the last game that truly sold it for our group. The demon was about to be killed through a smart deception from the ravenkeeper, but the spy successfully planted the idea that a poisoner could be about. Her words caused the good team to frantically analyze any possibility of their previous assumptions being wrong. We wavered over which outsider was in play for 10 minutes. The supposed recluse almost burst a blood vessel after we spent so much time considering if there was a drunk. It finally ended when we finally decided on killing the demon, the good team collapsing in a group hug when the storyteller announced that good had triumphed. We spent the next 30 minutes exhilarated and exhausted, going over all the craziness that had happened. It was the kind of high that any player of a social deduction game dreams of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit hard to explain what feels different between BOTC and its older cousins, but I think the biggest change is the lack of player elimination. Everyone can be involved for the whole game, and everyone &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to be involved for the whole game because they have their own unique role. This also means that the whole group is wrapped up in the dramatic tension at the end of the game – no one except the storyteller knows exactly what is going on. The game length varied a bit, but in general they were about 30 minutes all included with 7 players. The quick game length was definitely a plus overall, since most people got to experience different parts of the game with their different roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this is definitely my #1 social deduction game now. I loved the way I was not only always questioning other players, but also myself. Whenever I had a hunch about another player lying, I could reason out how that hunch could affect the given scenario. Victories and losses both felt very earned. I can’t wait to make printouts of the ‘Bad Moon Rising’ and ‘Violets and Sects’ modules, and I highly recommend anyone on the fence to print out a copy, grab a group, and try it for yourself. I’ll end by saying that I have never backed a kickstarter game before – and I hope to never do so again – but this is one game I really want to share with everyone I know and play it more.&lt;/p&gt;

275,,boardgames,"In a Chinese entertainment show called Keep Running, there was a variant mafia game with 10 people, where the mafia had to rip off a name-tag off the town people's backs in order to kill them. NOBODY knew what role the others were (even mafia didn't know who mafia were). The location was an empty old town, with clues interspersed throughout the area as to who the mafia were. The only way the town could kill mafia was by finding cards throughout the town on which they could write names, after then that person would instantly die. (Of course, mafia could use these cards too) 

Additionally, there was a shrine any number of people could walk into (3 in the ep), it would tell you if there was a majority of mafia in the shrine or not (green/red light). This shrine was the starting point of the game AND popped up two more times - in the middle, and to finish the game. 

The catch was that the players began the game with an intro along the lines of ""our elder died, but at least the three didn't manage to do anything else"" which made the players believe there were only 3 mafia, but it was actually a misleading statement nobody considered - there were actually only 3 town ; and it was CHAOS when people immediately betrayed their mafia status but ended up killing their own team off.

284,,boardgames,"Disclaimer: I'm not super involved in the meta of this sub, so sorry if this breaks a rule for posting content that I'm not aware of. Just let me know.

I heard a lot of mixed reviews on this sub about Charterstone before I bought it. Most of them were either negative or *bleh*. I've now played 10 of 12 sessions, and wanted to talk about why I think it is a super unique experience.

One fo the things I love about games is the excitement of a playing a new one. I think a lot of people share this: we play many games because we love the puzzle, and a new game is a new puzzle to solve. Charterstone, by unlocking new spots on the board locations, workers, and development cards, makes a new puzzle everytime you play. On top of this, the guideposts provide a new goal (and often a game altering, one-time special rule) which changes the puzzle regardless of the changes on the board. I know there are plenty of games that change the subset of cards we play with or the win conditions, offering ""infinite"" replayability. However, even though it is hard to explain why, Charterstone feels different. Maybe that's because Charterstone is always moving forward, subtracting and adding, insted of recombining the same mechanics. To put it abstractly, Charterstone's progress feels linear, while other games with a constantly-changing puzzle feel circular.

I also know that other Legacy games might offer something similar, but it seems that Charterstone's focus on being a Euro-game first puts the puzzle at the forefront, while most other legacy games to-date are plot-driven. I really hope there are other eurolegacy games in development, even though ti seems like the legacy craze has died down a bit.

This game isn't perfect of course, and I think this is its biggest flaw: I think it would be pretty hard to find 6 people in the same group who all loved this game, and I also can't imagine playing it without 6 people (there are rules for automated players that just wouldn't be the same). In my family 2 people love it, 2 like it, and 2 can't wait for it to be over.

The other biggest flaw is that in terms of scoring points and winning, I think the scoring incentivizes you to find a simple boring engine and hold on to it for dear life, instead of welcoming the changes and trying new strategies. That's why my wife was really bored with the game, despite winning half of the rounds. 

I got charterstone for 29.99 around October last year. When it gets down to that price, I highly recommend picking up a copy if you at all think you'd be interested. As much as I enjoyed it, I would've been happy paying retail price for it ($70/12 sessions = $8ish per night, divided by 6 people = $1.50 per person per night).",t2_161wju,False,,0,False,A Case for Charterstone,[],r/boardgames,False,6,,0,,False,t3_cau406,False,dark,,public,19,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,19,,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1562664897.0,text,6,,text,self.boardgames,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I&amp;#39;m not super involved in the meta of this sub, so sorry if this breaks a rule for posting content that I&amp;#39;m not aware of. Just let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard a lot of mixed reviews on this sub about Charterstone before I bought it. Most of them were either negative or &lt;em&gt;bleh&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;#39;ve now played 10 of 12 sessions, and wanted to talk about why I think it is a super unique experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One fo the things I love about games is the excitement of a playing a new one. I think a lot of people share this: we play many games because we love the puzzle, and a new game is a new puzzle to solve. Charterstone, by unlocking new spots on the board locations, workers, and development cards, makes a new puzzle everytime you play. On top of this, the guideposts provide a new goal (and often a game altering, one-time special rule) which changes the puzzle regardless of the changes on the board. I know there are plenty of games that change the subset of cards we play with or the win conditions, offering &amp;quot;infinite&amp;quot; replayability. However, even though it is hard to explain why, Charterstone feels different. Maybe that&amp;#39;s because Charterstone is always moving forward, subtracting and adding, insted of recombining the same mechanics. To put it abstractly, Charterstone&amp;#39;s progress feels linear, while other games with a constantly-changing puzzle feel circular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also know that other Legacy games might offer something similar, but it seems that Charterstone&amp;#39;s focus on being a Euro-game first puts the puzzle at the forefront, while most other legacy games to-date are plot-driven. I really hope there are other eurolegacy games in development, even though ti seems like the legacy craze has died down a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game isn&amp;#39;t perfect of course, and I think this is its biggest flaw: I think it would be pretty hard to find 6 people in the same group who all loved this game, and I also can&amp;#39;t imagine playing it without 6 people (there are rules for automated players that just wouldn&amp;#39;t be the same).

Also the tricks are more interesting to prepare for and combine and compete over.

298,,boardgames,"How is it that game designers (I'm particularly looking at you, kickstarter games) can't figure out that a lot of people like to sleeve their cards and adjust their box sizes accordingly. The sizes of the boxes I'm finding with modern games make no sense. They're slightly bigger than they need to be for simply holding what comes in them, but they're not big enough to hold sleeved cards? I understand that a lot of these campaigns make minimal (or no) profit, and they're trying to keep shipping costs down as much as they are trying to eliminate wasted box space, but games like Crypt, Unbroken, and Bargain Quest are all going to be sitting on my shelf with the lid awkwardly lifted an inch high. It seems like a tiny bit more planning could go into this stuff. I know that Unbroken even changed the sizes of some of the cards to fit in regular sleeves, because so many people wanted to sleeve it. Does this bother anyone else? Are there any game designers out there who can explain or defend why this is the case?

EDIT: Wow, this got a lot of great responses. After reading all y'all's comments, I should clarify a couple things:

1. For the purposes of this thread, I was just talking about overall box size, not the inserts. I'm pretty content to replace, adjust, or throw out my inserts now; as a couple of you pointed out, most are only there for shipping purposes. It's when stuff still doesn't fit that it starts to bother me.
2. I do sleeve cards that some of you have pointed out could go unsleeved - I like the feel of handling sleeved cards more, and I like protecting even non-shuffled, non-frequently-handled cards from accidental damage.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, it seems like the discussion boils down to a few points:

&amp;#x200B;

1. It looks like sleeving (at least complete sleeving) is less common that I assumed it to be. Maybe this isn't something that is on players' or designers' minds as much.
2. Someone mentioned that this is not a choice made by the designer, but by the publisher. That doesn't change my overall argument, but it definitely changes where I should have been directing it - thank you for clarifying this for me.
3. It sounds like cost and lack of necessity are the main forces at play. I suppose that's understandable, but I wish it would at least be a stretch goal on some projects or something... I would rather have slightly bigger box sizes than a special UV printed cover.

*How long have you been involved in the hobby?*

Since 2012. Due to extenuating life circumstances, I wound up taking care of my Mom full-time as she had developed dementia.  During that time, I stumbled across Wil Wheaton's TableTop Youtube show, and acquiring board games turned into a reward mechanism for me to cope with the situation I was in.  So down the rabbit hole I went.  About all of my games have been opened, punched out, but never played, since I really couldn't go out and make friends and have them over. I finally got back on my feet in 2017 and I joined a board game group earlier this year, and am finally culling my collection, getting rid of all the wheat, so I'm left with all the chaff. (Points if you get that reference)

*What would you change about your collection if you could?*

Oh man. So many things.  I wouldn't have gone nuts in the beginning, buying everything that looked appealing.  I'd also try to talk my former self off the ledge whenever I reasoned I could save $6 in shipping if I order another $50 worth of games.

*What is your favorite type of game?*

I love games that give me a story to tell afterwards.  Games like Burgle Bros., Robinson Crusoe, SW Outer Rim, Eldritch Horror, etc.

*What latest games have you bought?*

Wingspan, SW Outer Rim, and I have Century: Golem edition in the mail.  
  
*Anything leaving your collection soon?*

Castle Panic will be getting replaced by Carnival Zombie once the Kickstarter comes in; same with Suburbia, as I ordered the new KS edition.  I'm also getting rid of Qwirkle at some point.

*How long have you been playing:*

I've been more serious about building a collection for 5-6 years now. Played some games off and on with housemates for a while but really got into it around the time I got married. I grew up with the basic, luck-based board games of the 80's and I do still have a few of those in the collection.

*Organization:*

I have two Kallax 4x4 shelving cubes from IKEA. Games that fit in those cubes go in there and I usually try to fit similarly-sized boxes together. I like to have one heavy game on the bottom with a few lighter games stacked on top to maximize space without causing box damage. I also try to keep games and their expansions (when I'm actively using the expansion box) together. I also have a small plastic bin that has stuff like little card games and things like that on the bottom of the shelving unit, along with some expansion boxes I've kept for some reason.

Also, most of the stuff on the bottom shelf is stuff that I don't care about losing if the basement ever gets water in it. Games that are too big for the cubed shelving go on top.

*Favorite games I own:*

My current favorites would be:

* 7 Wonders
* Pandemic (in most of its iterations)
* Splendor
* Dominion (on top of the unit in the white cardboard box)
* Lanterns
* Alhambra

My wife and I discovered early on when dating (around 9 years ago, for reference) that we liked games, but we had the problem that usually one person was vastly better at a game than the other, which took some of the fun out of the game for us. Rather than let our shared hobby falter, I went on the hunt for a game we could both enjoy and remembered being briefly introduced to a game called Pandemic. I went out and found a copy. I taught the game to her and we were instantly hooked as she was thrilled with the idea that co-operative games actually existed. We've easily played Pandemic over a thousand times, starting from the original box (not stored on the shelf but instead off in general storage as we played that board and those cards to near death) up through most of its current themes. We typically play the game with open-hand and with each person controlling two characters (we found 4 player setups to be the most enjoyable to us). I can safely say that Pandemic is one of ""our things"" and provided us a great forum to get to know each other.

*Games I dislike:*

We were given the Lord of the Rings themed games in the upper right that I don't particularly care for. I don't care much for Monopoly anymore, but as a kid, I loved the game and was given a fairly nice copy of it, so I keep it around.

*Wishlist:*

I like games like Ascension and Race for the Galaxy, but my wife hates them, so I haven't been willing to pull the trigger on them since my friends who like those games play them. I'd like to finish off our Zombies collection ad my wife and I enjoy that game and, after moving, now have sufficient space to properly play it. I also know there is an expansion for Pandemic: the Cure that I need to get my hands on.

*Want to play:*

We haven't gotten 7 Wonders: Duel or Pandemic Legacy: Season 2 (NO SPOILERS) to the table yet as my wife needed a break from gaming for a while. Terra Mystica is another one I haven't yet gotten to the table. Dominion is also a game I want to play more but can be hard for me to get to the table.

*Unique Items:*

The Monopoly version I own is the 60th-anniversary version and it has a bunch of nice pieces, a sleek board, and a well-designed tray. It was definitely a triple-digit purchase my family made when I was a kid back in the early 90's, so I like to keep it around as a reminder of my family supporting me in a hobby they didn't care much for.

My wife brought a few unique games to the collection. She was born in the USA but has direct family in Germany, so she's acquired a few German games. 

*What I like best about the hobby:*

I like getting people together and just having a good time playing games, be it a co-op game or a highly competitive game. Fortunately, my group is a good mix of both types of gamers, so we get to a wide variety of games.",t2_e6ume,False,,0,False,Finally Got a Proper Game Shelf [COMC],"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'COMC'}]",r/boardgames,False,6,COMC,0,,False,t3_calu3i,False,dark,,public,26,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},COMC,False,26,,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1562625449.0,richtext,6,,text,self.boardgames,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collection Links: &lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward from the previous article all the way to now. Using the design pattern from the designer/developers as well as a TON of play-testing, here is the current state of [Shifting Desert’s Gaping Maw](https://imgur.com/a/ctU3DUf).

As you can see, a lot has changed. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how things got to the point that they are now:

&amp;#x200B;

**Special Rules (Part 2):**

Obviously I removed the Special Rule about Gathering whenever I placed a Presence. It was definitely too much and needed to go.

As suggested by another user over on the Spirit Island subreddit (credit: /u/desocupad0 ), I shifted directions a bit with the design. It was stated that even though the Spirit was thematically based on devouring and gathering, I was dealing Damage with my Innate Power rather than simply using the Destroy keyword. Similar “desert” cards (such as Drought) simply Destroy large amounts of buildings, but add Blight. I decided to embrace this idea and build the Spirit around these mechanics. As a result, Blight does not cascade where Shifting Desert has a Sacred Site.

I also revised the conversion of Energy to Sun as well. As much as I wanted it to work, I found that in that iteration of the Spirit I was always spending Energy to reach thresholds and ended up being starved the entire game. It didn’t feel good, so I abandoned the idea of wanting to hit ten Sun Elements in one Innate Power. Instead, the current Special Rule simply adds a Sun (max of 2) where you have Sacred Sites. So as long as you have 2 (which shouldn’t be hard for Shifting Desert) you’ll be able to reach a lot of your thresholds. The limit is two so that it's balanced around the solo game and doesn't get out of control with more players.

&amp;#x200B;

**Innate Powers (Part 3):**

*The Ravenous Hunger Devours*

This Power revealed time and time again that it was too hard to hit the later Elemental thresholds even late into the game, that was a problem. It's still something that I'm working with, but it will get there in time. It was decided that Shifting Desert was primarily a Spirit of the Sun rather than Earth, so that shifted things around a bit. One iteration of the Innate Power had an extra threshold on the ability to add one extra range. It came from the fact that Shifting Desert couldn't deal with Cities that aren’t built in the Sands. It felt as though I was trying to make it plausible to deal with everything when that's not what balance means. So I offloaded some of that power into one of the Unique Power Cards and that allowed me to remove it from this Innate Power. I also changed the Damage the Innate Power was doing simply because twelve was definitely too much, and we couldn’t ever get that much health into a Sands location in any of our play-tests either. As was mentioned previously, it was brought to my attention that most desert-based Powers simply destroy buildings and don't worry about Damage values. So I modified the Innate Power to work similarly.

*Mirage Leads to Certain Demise*

Yeah, it was really busted the iteration I showed off in third article as well. Repeating a Gather effect even once is really powerful. Gathering two Explorers really makes the game a cakewalk in the early game which leads to a nearly non-existent or non-threatening late game. The current version is easy to Gather one, but Gathering more than one takes effort and by that time it doesn't make the game trivial.

&amp;#x200B;

**Unique Powers (Part 4):**

*Scorch With Desert Heat*

Somehow I’m surprised that this one stayed relatively the same for the longest time in its purest form. It just felt good once I made it match how Flash Flood works for River Surges. With the mention of a theme change (Damage to Destroy) it didn't take much to modify this Power. It allows for some good choices, it's an effective Power assuming you don't use it terribly and destroy lots of Dahan with it. Really liking how this one feels.

*Revitalizing Oasis*

I wanted a way for Desert to deal with adding the Blight that it did, so this was the solution. It has a use outside of clearing out Blight and it feels good to use. I like the conditional having two Dahan so that the Blight removal isn't free. For now it's in a good place.

*Bury In Tombs Of Sand*

This Power allows for some flexibility when wanting to Destroy just one Town or being and to deal with them just outside of your range.

*Blinding Sandstorms*

A defensive Power. There's not too much going on here. It incentivizes placing lots of Presence in the same location. I like how it feels, I'll probably need to tweak the numbers a little more since it feels like it Defends just a bit too much sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Growth Options (Part 5)**

Things changed a bit here. I went looking at River Surges and Thunderspeaker for guidance, since they seemed (to me) to be Spirits of the Sun as well. After taking a break from Shifting Desert and playing a few games of River, I learned that I really liked how it could place two Presence with one option, but you could only do it if you were fine everywhere else. I also took an idea from River where it only gained Energy by using the Reclaim All option.

I took the Reclaim One option from River and Thunderspeaker and put it into Shifting Desert’s Presence Tracks as well. It doesn't feel as mandatory as it does when playing River, but it's still a good spike in Power.

One of the biggest things that I learned while making Desert is that Presence Tracks are a lot harder to balance and figure out than I had originally thought. Several iterations had lots of Elements in them and some of them ramped up too quickly. Now that I had a double place Presence option, the Presence Tracks needed to be weaker. I'm still messing around with the Energy gain, but it feels good at the moment. Turns out most of the power in the Spirit and how it fares in each state of the game is largely determined by how it's Presence Tracks are set up.

&amp;#x200B;

**Structural Testing (Part 6)**

Does it work? Yes, yes it does.

&amp;#x200B;

**Coherence Testing (Part 7)**

Do all the pieces contribute?

I found this part of play-testing to be the hardest. I found that during several iterations of the Unique Power Cards there were too many times where I just wanted to Reclaim my hand and play the same two Powers over and over again. Other times I would never use one of the Unique Power Cards and simply save it as forget-fodder for Major Powers later. Both of these are signs that the coherence of the Spirit is off and that something needs to be changed.

In its current form, I use all of the Unique Power Cards fairly equally and I know the Coherence Testing portion of the design is a lot better than before due to a specific scenario that occurred a few times during testing. I had forgotten one of my Unique Power Cards in order to acquire a Major Power and then ON THE VERY NEXT TURN I looked in my hand and wondered where that Unique Power Card had gone because the board suddenly had a great way for it to be played. I looked for it in my hand and realized with horror that I had just forgotten it. It made me smile when I realized that each of the Unique Power Cards had their place. It wasn’t just one Unique Power Card either, this has happened with three of the four.

&amp;#x200B;

**Balance Testing (Part 8)**

Is the power level appropriate?

I think so. It doesn’t invalidate the early game and struggles with larger clumps of Invaders in the late game. It can play for Major Powers if it has to, but it isn’t a sustainable way to play the Spirit for more than a turn.

Here’s the best part (for me, at least), I kept track of all my revisions throughout the process and it's been amazing to watch how certain events caused a shift in ideologies and designs.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for a few miscellaneous tips and things from the designer/developers (just in case you haven’t heard them before). These aren't in a coherent order, just a smattering of some thoughts that helped my process a lot:

&amp;#x200B;

Ted:

&gt;Unique Powers don't necessarily cost the same as Minor Powers (some cost 2 or 3) but they use the same costing formula. Every effect has an associated energy value, and the cost of a Minor Power reflects that value. 1 card play is also a cost, worth (IIRC) about 2 energy. So a Minor Power that costs 0 has an effect worth about 2 energy, and a Minor Power that costs 1 has an effect worth about 3 energy. Unique Powers use the same costing formula, so a unique power that costs 2 will have a 4 energy effect, etc. A Unique Power that costs 0-1 should have the same power level as a Minor Power with the same cost.  
&gt;  
&gt;“A lot of this centers around the Element Pie (Spirit Island's take on MtG's color pie). Basically which effects belong to which elements. For example, Sun is the element of command, so many effects which move Dahan have Sun. Moon is the element of change and transformation. Earth is about consistency and repetition, so the earth spirits tend to have a relatively stronger ""reclaim all"" growth option. Air is the opposite-- air spirits have a weaker reclaim all.  
&gt;  
&gt;And of course there's other stuff not affiliated with elements that range from good guidelines to hard rules. For example, Spirits can never destroy Dahan for a resource gain. They can only destroy Dahan as collateral damage. That's a hard rule. Cities can never be moved-- that's just a guideline, which a few major powers can break. But you need a really good reason to break it.

&amp;#x200B;

Leif:

&gt;Major Powers, on the other hand, get a discount (I don't recall how much) to account for the cost of forgetting a power. So a Major Power that costs 2 will be more powerful than a Unique Power that costs 2.  
&gt;  
&gt;A low complexity spirit may never have elements on its presence tracks.

&amp;#x200B;

Dylan:

&gt;Some tidbits to bear in mind:  
&gt;  
&gt;\* Elements have value. To fine-tune the cost of a card, add or subtract elements.  
&gt;  
&gt;\* Card plays have value. A 0-cost card provides benefit, because you're giving up something to play the card.  
&gt;  
&gt;\* Targeting restrictions lower the cost of a card.  
&gt;  
&gt;\* Unique powers need to be costed the same way as other powers, or it warps the game in undesirable way.  
&gt;  
&gt;\* Major Powers are costed approximately as if you never hit the threshold. The extra benefit of sometimes hitting the threshold cancels the cost of having to forget a card.

&amp;#x200B;

Eric:

&gt;I have an extremely crufty spreadsheet for Power Card costing. It's very much a starting-point, **not** an end-all-and-be-all - it comes in spot-on for fairly vanilla Minor Powers, but multi-part effects can have internal synergies/anti-synergies, and uncommon effects don't necessarily have a pinned-down cost. (Or I have a cost but know it's not quite right.) Also, some modifiers (eg: Fast, Range, terrain restrictions) are really more multipliers than flat adds/subtracts - I have flat adds/subtracts that I use for low-cost Powers, but need to scale them up when dealing with higher costs.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Growth costing is more recent, and is in Ted's + my heads.  
&gt;  
&gt;Uniques are usually costed exactly as per Minors, but:  
&gt;  
&gt;(a) This is deceptive, because when you add/remove an element from a Unique Power Card you know \*exactly\* how awesome/terrible it is for the Spirit getting it based on what their innates need, whereas for a Minor Power it's just a probabilistic minor nudge to the costing;  
&gt;  
&gt;(b) Unique Power Cards \*can\* vary off of normal costing if need be, but doing so by too much creates often-undesirable dynamics. If you overcost/underpower the Unique Power, it becomes Forget-fodder for a Major Power (or perhaps Choice Event). If you undercost/overpower it, it makes Reclaim effects more valuable, and can over-synergize with things that allow Repeats - e.g., if you made a Spirit that had a Unique Power that should cost 5-6 Energy but only cost 1, its game would probably focus around trying to flog that as much as possible.  
&gt;  
&gt;Major Powers do get a small boost just for being Majors, but not nearly enough to compensate for the loss of a Power Card (a Major Power that did the exact same thing as a Minor Power would cost about 2/3 of an Energy less). The opportunity for hitting threshold effects fills in the rest of that value. Earlier iterations had actual costing formulas for threshold effects - e.g., ""A 3-3-2 threshold should have an effect that's about N% of the value of the main effect"" - but eventually I was going more on play experience than numbers and just stopped updating the model.  
&gt;  
&gt;The concept of ""element pie"" is much looser in Spirit Island than in M:tG. The same effect might provide / require radically different elements depending on *how* it's being enacted. But there are definitely trends.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ted's list is pretty much spot-on for development, and nicely captures layers of importance / ripple-effects. It doesn't cover the way I initially come up with designs, though, which tends to be more of a ping-pong iteration between theme and mechanics, using each to brainstorm on / flesh out the other.  
&gt;  
&gt;Whatever the guide, one step - or perhaps a follow-on to every step - is going to be ""iterate a lot"". :-)

And with that, I bid you all adieu. It’s been quite the adventure and hopefully someone was able to glean from my choices and mistakes. I love talking about the design process of creating Spirits for this wonderful game.

My TL;DR for this entire journey is summarized by the title of this final article. No matter what you do, or how much research you put into your own Spirit, you need to iterate upon the idea. Make small changes and put it through the testing cycle again. Keep doing it until you’re happy where it is. It could take one iteration, it could take dozens, or even hundreds (as I’m sure the official Spirits do/did).

You’ve all heard enough from me these past few weeks. If you have any questions about anything in this regard, I would love to talk about them. Until next time, I’ll be working on Vicious Thorns Lash Out In Anger and Swampy Swamp Swamps a Swampy Swamp (because names are hard).",t2_nqwfg,False,,0,False,"Spirit Island Home-brew - Pt. 5 (Final) - Iterate, Iterate, Iterate",[],r/boardgames,False,6,,0,,False,t3_cakhsi,False,dark,#edeff1,public,33,0,{},,2fdfa772-9cf0-11e8-922c-0e3a76b3c6b0,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,33,,self,1562589729.0,,"[{'a': ':spirit_island:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/5dhccdeqncf11_t5_2qmjp/spirit_island'}, {'e': 'text', 't': ' Heart of the Wildfire'}]",{},,True,,1562618229.0,text,6,,richtext,self.boardgames,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Eric: I agree to the terms for creating Spirit Island game elements&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=""https://querki.net/u/darker/spirit-island-faq/#!.9v5ka4u""&gt;&lt;em&gt;set forth in the FAQ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward from the previous article all the way to now. Using the design pattern from the designer/developers as well as a TON of play-testing, here is the current state of &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/ctU3DUf""&gt;Shifting Desert’s Gaping Maw&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, a lot has changed. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how things got to the point that they are now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special Rules (Part 2):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously I removed the Special Rule about Gathering whenever I placed a Presence. It was definitely too much and needed to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As suggested by another user over on the Spirit Island subreddit (credit: &lt;a href=""/u/desocupad0""&gt;/u/desocupad0&lt;/a&gt; ), I shifted directions a bit with the design. It was stated that even though the Spirit was thematically based on devouring and gathering, I was dealing Damage with my Innate Power rather than simply using the Destroy keyword. Similar “desert” cards (such as Drought) simply Destroy large amounts of buildings, but add Blight. I decided to embrace this idea and build the Spirit around these mechanics. As a result, Blight does not cascade where Shifting Desert has a Sacred Site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also revised the conversion of Energy to Sun as well. As much as I wanted it to work, I found that in that iteration of the Spirit I was always spending Energy to reach thresholds and ended up being starved the entire game. It didn’t feel good, so I abandoned the idea of wanting to hit ten Sun Elements in one Innate Power. Instead, the current Special Rule simply adds a Sun (max of 2) where you have Sacred Sites. So as long as you have 2 (which shouldn’t be hard for Shifting Desert) you’ll be able to reach a lot of your thresholds. The limit is two so that it&amp;#39;s balanced around the solo game and doesn&amp;#39;t get out of control with more players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innate Powers (Part 3):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ravenous Hunger Devours&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Power revealed time and time again that it was too hard to hit the later Elemental thresholds even late into the game, that was a problem. It&amp;#39;s still something that I&amp;#39;m working with, but it will get there in time. It was decided that Shifting Desert was primarily a Spirit of the Sun rather than Earth, so that shifted things around a bit. One iteration of the Innate Power had an extra threshold on the ability to add one extra range. It came from the fact that Shifting Desert couldn&amp;#39;t deal with Cities that aren’t built in the Sands. It felt as though I was trying to make it plausible to deal with everything when that&amp;#39;s not what balance means. So I offloaded some of that power into one of the Unique Power Cards and that allowed me to remove it from this Innate Power. I also changed the Damage the Innate Power was doing simply because twelve was definitely too much, and we couldn’t ever get that much health into a Sands location in any of our play-tests either. As was mentioned previously, it was brought to my attention that most desert-based Powers simply destroy buildings and don&amp;#39;t worry about Damage values. So I modified the Innate Power to work similarly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mirage Leads to Certain Demise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it was really busted the iteration I showed off in third article as well. Repeating a Gather effect even once is really powerful. Gathering two Explorers really makes the game a cakewalk in the early game which leads to a nearly non-existent or non-threatening late game. The current version is easy to Gather one, but Gathering more than one takes effort and by that time it doesn&amp;#39;t make the game trivial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique Powers (Part 4):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scorch With Desert Heat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow I’m surprised that this one stayed relatively the same for the longest time in its purest form. It just felt good once I made it match how Flash Flood works for River Surges. With the mention of a theme change (Damage to Destroy) it didn&amp;#39;t take much to modify this Power. It allows for some good choices, it&amp;#39;s an effective Power assuming you don&amp;#39;t use it terribly and destroy lots of Dahan with it. Really liking how this one feels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revitalizing Oasis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted a way for Desert to deal with adding the Blight that it did, so this was the solution. It has a use outside of clearing out Blight and it feels good to use. I like the conditional having two Dahan so that the Blight removal isn&amp;#39;t free. For now it&amp;#39;s in a good place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bury In Tombs Of Sand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Power allows for some flexibility when wanting to Destroy just one Town or being and to deal with them just outside of your range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blinding Sandstorms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A defensive Power. There&amp;#39;s not too much going on here. It incentivizes placing lots of Presence in the same location. I like how it feels, I&amp;#39;ll probably need to tweak the numbers a little more since it feels like it Defends just a bit too much sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growth Options (Part 5)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things changed a bit here. I went looking at River Surges and Thunderspeaker for guidance, since they seemed (to me) to be Spirits of the Sun as well. After taking a break from Shifting Desert and playing a few games of River, I learned that I really liked how it could place two Presence with one option, but you could only do it if you were fine everywhere else. I also took an idea from River where it only gained Energy by using the Reclaim All option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the Reclaim One option from River and Thunderspeaker and put it into Shifting Desert’s Presence Tracks as well. It doesn&amp;#39;t feel as mandatory as it does when playing River, but it&amp;#39;s still a good spike in Power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest things that I learned while making Desert is that Presence Tracks are a lot harder to balance and figure out than I had originally thought. Several iterations had lots of Elements in them and some of them ramped up too quickly. Now that I had a double place Presence option, the Presence Tracks needed to be weaker. I&amp;#39;m still messing around with the Energy gain, but it feels good at the moment. Turns out most of the power in the Spirit and how it fares in each state of the game is largely determined by how it&amp;#39;s Presence Tracks are set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural Testing (Part 6)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it work? Yes, yes it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coherence Testing (Part 7)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do all the pieces contribute?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this part of play-testing to be the hardest. I found that during several iterations of the Unique Power Cards there were too many times where I just wanted to Reclaim my hand and play the same two Powers over and over again. Other times I would never use one of the Unique Power Cards and simply save it as forget-fodder for Major Powers later. Both of these are signs that the coherence of the Spirit is off and that something needs to be changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its current form, I use all of the Unique Power Cards fairly equally and I know the Coherence Testing portion of the design is a lot better than before due to a specific scenario that occurred a few times during testing. I had forgotten one of my Unique Power Cards in order to acquire a Major Power and then ON THE VERY NEXT TURN I looked in my hand and wondered where that Unique Power Card had gone because the board suddenly had a great way for it to be played. I looked for it in my hand and realized with horror that I had just forgotten it. It made me smile when I realized that each of the Unique Power Cards had their place. It wasn’t just one Unique Power Card either, this has happened with three of the four.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balance Testing (Part 8)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the power level appropriate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think so. It doesn’t invalidate the early game and struggles with larger clumps of Invaders in the late game. It can play for Major Powers if it has to, but it isn’t a sustainable way to play the Spirit for more than a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the best part (for me, at least), I kept track of all my revisions throughout the process and it&amp;#39;s been amazing to watch how certain events caused a shift in ideologies and designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for a few miscellaneous tips and things from the designer/developers (just in case you haven’t heard them before). These aren&amp;#39;t in a coherent order, just a smattering of some thoughts that helped my process a lot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unique Powers don&amp;#39;t necessarily cost the same as Minor Powers (some cost 2 or 3) but they use the same costing formula. Every effect has an associated energy value, and the cost of a Minor Power reflects that value. 1 card play is also a cost, worth (IIRC) about 2 energy. So a Minor Power that costs 0 has an effect worth about 2 energy, and a Minor Power that costs 1 has an effect worth about 3 energy. Unique Powers use the same costing formula, so a unique power that costs 2 will have a 4 energy effect, etc. A Unique Power that costs 0-1 should have the same power level as a Minor Power with the same cost.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A lot of this centers around the Element Pie (Spirit Island&amp;#39;s take on MtG&amp;#39;s color pie). Basically which effects belong to which elements. For example, Sun is the element of command, so many effects which move Dahan have Sun. Moon is the element of change and transformation. Earth is about consistency and repetition, so the earth spirits tend to have a relatively stronger &amp;quot;reclaim all&amp;quot; growth option. Air is the opposite-- air spirits have a weaker reclaim all.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course there&amp;#39;s other stuff not affiliated with elements that range from good guidelines to hard rules. For example, Spirits can never destroy Dahan for a resource gain. They can only destroy Dahan as collateral damage. That&amp;#39;s a hard rule. Cities can never be moved-- that&amp;#39;s just a guideline, which a few major powers can break. But you need a really good reason to break it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leif:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major Powers, on the other hand, get a discount (I don&amp;#39;t recall how much) to account for the cost of forgetting a power. So a Major Power that costs 2 will be more powerful than a Unique Power that costs 2.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A low complexity spirit may never have elements on its presence tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dylan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some tidbits to bear in mind:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Elements have value. To fine-tune the cost of a card, add or subtract elements.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Card plays have value. A 0-cost card provides benefit, because you&amp;#39;re giving up something to play the card.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Targeting restrictions lower the cost of a card.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Unique powers need to be costed the same way as other powers, or it warps the game in undesirable way.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Major Powers are costed approximately as if you never hit the threshold. The extra benefit of sometimes hitting the threshold cancels the cost of having to forget a card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an extremely crufty spreadsheet for Power Card costing. It&amp;#39;s very much a starting-point, &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; an end-all-and-be-all - it comes in spot-on for fairly vanilla Minor Powers, but multi-part effects can have internal synergies/anti-synergies, and uncommon effects don&amp;#39;t necessarily have a pinned-down cost. (Or I have a cost but know it&amp;#39;s not quite right.) Also, some modifiers (eg: Fast, Range, terrain restrictions) are really more multipliers than flat adds/subtracts - I have flat adds/subtracts that I use for low-cost Powers, but need to scale them up when dealing with higher costs.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Growth costing is more recent, and is in Ted&amp;#39;s + my heads.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uniques are usually costed exactly as per Minors, but:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(a) This is deceptive, because when you add/remove an element from a Unique Power Card you know *exactly* how awesome/terrible it is for the Spirit getting it based on what their innates need, whereas for a Minor Power it&amp;#39;s just a probabilistic minor nudge to the costing;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(b) Unique Power Cards *can* vary off of normal costing if need be, but doing so by too much creates often-undesirable dynamics. If you overcost/underpower the Unique Power, it becomes Forget-fodder for a Major Power (or perhaps Choice Event). If you undercost/overpower it, it makes Reclaim effects more valuable, and can over-synergize with things that allow Repeats - e.g., if you made a Spirit that had a Unique Power that should cost 5-6 Energy but only cost 1, its game would probably focus around trying to flog that as much as possible.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major Powers do get a small boost just for being Majors, but not nearly enough to compensate for the loss of a Power Card (a Major Power that did the exact same thing as a Minor Power would cost about 2/3 of an Energy less). The opportunity for hitting threshold effects fills in the rest of that value. Earlier iterations had actual costing formulas for threshold effects - e.g., &amp;quot;A 3-3-2 threshold should have an effect that&amp;#39;s about N% of the value of the main effect&amp;quot; - but eventually I was going more on play experience than numbers and just stopped updating the model.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of &amp;quot;element pie&amp;quot; is much looser in Spirit Island than in M:tG. The same effect might provide / require radically different elements depending on &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; it&amp;#39;s being enacted. But there are definitely trends.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ted&amp;#39;s list is pretty much spot-on for development, and nicely captures layers of importance / ripple-effects. It doesn&amp;#39;t cover the way I initially come up with designs, though, which tends to be more of a ping-pong iteration between theme and mechanics, using each to brainstorm on / flesh out the other.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the guide, one step - or perhaps a follow-on to every step - is going to be &amp;quot;iterate a lot&amp;quot;. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with that, I bid you all adieu. It’s been quite the adventure and hopefully someone was able to glean from my choices and mistakes. I love talking about the design process of creating Spirits for this wonderful game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My TL;DR for this entire journey is summarized by the title of this final article. No matter what you do, or how much research you put into your own Spirit, you need to iterate upon the idea. Make small changes and put it through the testing cycle again. Keep doing it until you’re happy where it is. It could take one iteration, it could take dozens, or even hundreds (as I’m sure the official Spirits do/did).&lt;/p&gt;

309,,boardgames,"My wife recently surprised me with a copy of Twilight Imperium Forth Edition. The price tag and the game length are what held me back, but my wife bought it for me anyways. Tonight we played our first game, a 4 player game. We played for 13 hours including set up, learning, and eating breaks. We had to end early though, and finished with my wife and I tied at 8 points, but one of us would have won next round.

I can say without hesitation or doubt, this was the greatest gaming experience I have ever had. Everything about this game was firing on all cylinders, it's worth every penny. It will outshine all your other boardgames, so buy it now and save yourself some money, or buy it later after you've bought other games you won't play after twilight imperium. 

Player interaction is where Twilight Imperium out shines other games. You are forced to expand if you want to gain victory points and grow your army. As the board gets crowded, and armies get larger, simply moveing one space over, or building a new fleet can generate debate and discussion. Also, after each round you cast votes for or against new rules, or elect players or planets to recieve good or bad conditions. This voting creates heated debates and bartering.

Combat is very exciting, and your success is balanced between luck and strategy. Have you upgraded your ships enough before hand? Do you have secret action cards to destroy your opponents fleet, or nullify their attacks? You decide which ships of yours get destroyed in combat, which is where strategy comes in. After the battle in outer space is complete, the next step is invading the planet below. Bombardment from ships, space cannons, and infantry all play a part in this phase. 

The Lore, and 17 playable races, all make for an immersive experience. Reading the introduction pulls you in to make you feel like your really part of this galactic battle. And reading your races Lore makes you feel connected in some way. 

I wish I made the plunge earlier, because this game is it. It trumps all other war/strategy game Imo.

## Footnotes
- `#hmm` means that something about the project seems a little off. Buyer beware kinda thing.
- `#lolwut` is reserved for projects that seem like copycat games or campaigns put together with little thought. Check 'em out for amusement.
- `#take` tags are for projects that have been restarted for some reason, with the number indicating what iteration we're currently on.
- Did I miss something? Particularly something **new in the last 7 days** or **ending in the next 7 days**? Let me know in the comments and I'll add it in.

323,,boardgames,"I am not going to rant and rave about this but I will explain more in comments as I see others views but the abstract to this debate is:

Generally, media such as films and TV has been getting longer and longer over the last few years. Netflix has turned 3 hour series into 12 hour series. Board games have been subsumed. Almost every game I play, the change that happens throughout the game is too slow or stagnates in the middle. Root has a part just after the initial expansion where everyone builds up and no-one does much. Games with rounds often go for 8 when it should have been 6.

Games tend to edge on the well that didn’t feel too long when it was okay when I feel we would be okay with tight game experiences that almost feel like you get your hands chopped off. Length does not equal depth.

EDIT: I have no problem with long games. My facourite game is Spirit Island which is long and hefty but the game is dynamic and uses the time to craft an experience that I can’t imagine in a shorter timeframe. A game like teotihuacan, a well crafted game with mid to high mid euro level depth and looks good, takes 2 and a half to 3 hours for an experience that to me feels like it should take an hour and a half.

Please don’t tell me that I should just play shorter games.",t2_yajk0,False,,0,False,DISCUSSION: Board games on the whole are designed 30 minutes too long.,[],r/boardgames,False,6,,0,,False,t3_cawjev,False,dark,,public,0,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,self,1562684832.0,,[],{},,True,,1562678989.0,text,6,,text,self.boardgames,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not going to rant and rave about this but I will explain more in comments as I see others views but the abstract to this debate is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, media such as films and TV has been getting longer and longer over the last few years. Netflix has turned 3 hour series into 12 hour series. Board games have been subsumed. Almost every game I play, the change that happens throughout the game is too slow or stagnates in the middle. Root has a part just after the initial expansion where everyone builds up and no-one does much. Games with rounds often go for 8 when it should have been 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Games tend to edge on the well that didn’t feel too long when it was okay when I feel we would be okay with tight game experiences that almost feel like you get your hands chopped off. Length does not equal depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I have no problem with long games. My facourite game is Spirit Island which is long and hefty but the game is dynamic and uses the time to craft an experience that I can’t imagine in a shorter timeframe. A game like teotihuacan, a well crafted game with mid to high mid euro level depth and looks good, takes 2 and a half to 3 hours for an experience that to me feels like it should take an hour and a half.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

*How long have you been playing:*

I've been in hobby boardgames for about 5 years now, it started out with lighter stuff, Ticket to Ride, Splendor, King of Tokyo etc... Now I vastly prefer heavy, Euro games but will still play almost anything at least once. Prior to hobby boardgames I did a good amount of D&amp;D, about 20 years of MTG and then the classic midwestern upbringing of playing cards, Euchre, Hearts etc...

&amp;#x200B;

*Organization:*

My storage is more or less organized by weight (heavier games on top) and then box size but I don't really put too much thought into it.

&amp;#x200B;

*Favorite games I own:*

If I had to pick my current 5 favorite games that I own it would be (no particular order): Lisboa, Brass Birmingham, Food Chain Magnate, Great Western Trail, and Gaia Project.

&amp;#x200B;

*Games I dislike:*

I do a pretty good job of curating my collection and getting rid of games that are no longer to my tastes or that I've outgrown, for example I no longer have the classic gateway games of Catan, Ticket to Ride etc.. I also keep a decent amount that even though I don't care for much, they are good games to play with my kids who are still young like, King of Tokyo, Castle Panic, Splendor.

&amp;#x200B;

*Wishlist:*

I backed the new Age of Steam kickstarter as well as the Irish Gauge preorder so I am pretty excited about both of those coming in. I was just at Origins and I'm kind of kicking myself for not picking up Pipeline, but I was unsure about it and didn't really get an opportunity to properly demo it. I also wouldn't mind picking up Vinhos, as I tend to like Lacerda games.

&amp;#x200B;

*Want to play:*

I haven't had the chance to get The Gallerist to the table yet and I've only played Escape Plan once, so both of those are pretty high on my want to play list. Pretty much any game on my top shelf though I would play in a second. I love Hansa Teutonica but for some reason have a really hard time selling people on it and getting it to the table, it is such a good game and I really want to play it at 5p. Same with Wildcatters, I love the game but it doesn't get out very often and when it does it is usually at 3p, the game really shines at 4p.

&amp;#x200B;

*What I like best about the hobby:*

Honestly just hanging out with friends and enjoying an activity together. I've been pretty blessed that my core group of friends for the past 20 years are all gamers and we still get together to play, I've also met some good friends through Meetup and we now meet outside of that. It is a great hobby and community, I like that as I approach middle age I can still learn new things frequently. When I was at Origins my group was getting ready to start a game of Terra Mystica and a random stranger, who was at least 60+ years old, came up and asked to join. I really love that about the hobby and if, 20 something years from now, I am still attending cons and am able to randomly join a game, I'll consider that  a pretty good life.",t2_b42jh,False,,0,False,"[COMC] 5 years in the hobby, finally have a dedicated shelf","[{'e': 'text', 't': 'COMC'}]",r/boardgames,False,6,COMC,0,,False,t3_caar3o,False,dark,,public,39,0,{},,dea07cbc-18aa-11e7-be9d-0ed152d2be1c,False,[],,False,False,,{},COMC,False,39,,self,False,hansa-teutonica,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Hansa Teutonica'}]",{},,True,,1562556162.0,richtext,6,,richtext,self.boardgames,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some links to my collection, I try to keep it at around 50ish games (not counting expansions):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to pick my current 5 favorite games that I own it would be (no particular order): Lisboa, Brass Birmingham, Food Chain Magnate, Great Western Trail, and Gaia Project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Games I dislike:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do a pretty good job of curating my collection and getting rid of games that are no longer to my tastes or that I&amp;#39;ve outgrown, for example I no longer have the classic gateway games of Catan, Ticket to Ride etc.. I also keep a decent amount that even though I don&amp;#39;t care for much, they are good games to play with my kids who are still young like, King of Tokyo, Castle Panic, Splendor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wishlist:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I backed the new Age of Steam kickstarter as well as the Irish Gauge preorder so I am pretty excited about both of those coming in. I was just at Origins and I&amp;#39;m kind of kicking myself for not picking up Pipeline, but I was unsure about it and didn&amp;#39;t really get an opportunity to properly demo it. I also wouldn&amp;#39;t mind picking up Vinhos, as I tend to like Lacerda games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want to play:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t had the chance to get The Gallerist to the table yet and I&amp;#39;ve only played Escape Plan once, so both of those are pretty high on my want to play list. Pretty much any game on my top shelf though I would play in a second. I love Hansa Teutonica but for some reason have a really hard time selling people on it and getting it to the table, it is such a good game and I really want to play it at 5p. Same with Wildcatters, I love the game but it doesn&amp;#39;t get out very often and when it does it is usually at 3p, the game really shines at 4p.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What I like best about the hobby:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly just hanging out with friends and enjoying an activity together. I&amp;#39;ve been pretty blessed that my core group of friends for the past 20 years are all gamers and we still get together to play, I&amp;#39;ve also met some good friends through Meetup and we now meet outside of that. It is a great hobby and community, I like that as I approach middle age I can still learn new things frequently. When I was at Origins my group was getting ready to start a game of Terra Mystica and a random stranger, who was at least 60+ years old, came up and asked to join. I really love that about the hobby and if, 20 something years from now, I am still attending cons and am able to randomly join a game, I&amp;#39;ll consider that  a pretty good life.&lt;/p&gt;

337,,boardgames,"Although I have a lot of board games that have some cards as components, I typically don't like card based games. The only game I've ever purchased sleeves for is Coup, and with Coup, just the 15 sleeved cards tend to slide out of the stack because of the smoothness of the sleeves.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, to my surprise, I fell in love with 2 deck building games at Origins Game Fair. One was Boss Monster 3, which we bought on the spot after playing a demo, and the other was Star Realms, which I bought after playing the digital version that I got a free code for at Origins.

&amp;#x200B;

Since these are games that are fully card based, I'm thinking about buying sleeves. But these games have lots and lots of cards, so I'm thinking about how much the small amount of Coup cards slide around and I can't imagine having a stack of 80 Star Realms sleeved cards.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know much about card sleeves, so are there certain better sleeves for games with large stacks? Are there sleeves that are not so smooth that don't slide around as much? Even if so, it seems like the additional thickness of the cards would make some of these larger decks enormous and make them teeter over easily.

&amp;#x200B;

How is that usually dealt with for larger decks like this?

356,,boardgames,"With the help of some super fantastic artists I've been building the board game The Quest for the Fountain of Youth. We just finished alpha testing the game and are going to be redoing the map completely but I was hoping for some constructive criticism, feedback, and honestly some real discussion about why the game might be fun and why it might not be fun. 

&amp;#x200B;

The main goal of the game is to get to the Fountain of Youth. To do so you must collect treasure as you round the game board which consists of 5 different regions (Ocean, Tundra, Desert, Jungle, Skies). Through out the map there are merchants. Once you collect enough treasure you stop at a merchant and purchase an ancient relic. There are 5 of these relics and you must have all of them to reach the fountain of youth and win the game. Each of these relics is region matched and can only be purchased at it's region's merchant. Once you've collected all of the relics you must be the first to the Fountain of Youth, following one of 5 river paths that separate the regions up to the Fountain itself which is in the middle of the board. 

Also purchasable at merchants are Merchant cards. You may only purchase one merchant card per turn and may only hold 3 at a time. These can give you a significant advantage during the game, such as stealing another players relic, teleporting around the board, etc. You cannot use a Merchant Card the same round you purchase it. 

A normal roll would be rolling a D6, moving the number of spaces, drawing a Field Card which is how you collect or lose treasure. These cards can be Gain 1, 2, 3, Lose 1, 2, 3, Lose a Turn, Gain an extra turn, go back two spaces. If you land on a merchant before your dice roll is up you continue moving after you're done purchasing. This is where things can get a little spicy.

Field cards not only effect the person who drew them, but who ever is in the region the card is based. The Field card deck consists of 50 card, 10 for each region. 

After the effect of your Field Card is complete it is discarded and your turn is over. 

I'm sure there are things I'm forgetting to detail in here, but this is the jist of the game.

372,,boardgames,"I have a friend who rates many games as a 10. They tell me that they have a positive outlook on games. I believe that is probably true knowing the person and his collection.

&amp;#x200B;

But the amount of 10's you have rated could mean a number of things. Is it an indication of playing a lot of games? Is it an indication of favorable first impressions and then not adjusting those ratings? Might you rate games that you have backed as 10's? Maybe you don't believe there are any perfect games out there, therefore you don't have any 10's. Or maybe you have the average number of 10's in your collection.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to propose a benchmark: I am guessing that most people have enough games rated a 10 to fill out there top 10. To that end I would like people to comment with how many 10's they have rated beyond their top 10 games; mine would be a -1 as I have 9 games rated as a 10. Then also give their best guess as to why they are not near a zero; for me I believe I am in the average, but I am probably wrong.

Suggested format:

**-1**I believe I am in the average.  I own about 200 games so that would put my 10's at about 5% of the games I own.

374,,boardgames,"Last night, 4 of us played GoT board game with Mother of Dragon expansion. We were all new to the game from from the time we arrived to finish, it took us 8 hours. 
We did not include Essos, Targaryen or Iron Bank but included Vassals, new Sea orders and ability to trade Power Tokens, Arryn and overlay tiles. Based on a threat from OP, we picked Dorne, Arryn, GJ and Tyrell as our houses. We had 3 vassals - Lannister, Start and Bar.
We enjoyed it overall but we found it very frustrating. I was Arryn and the Dorne player starts with Iron Throne and Raven ...
The Influence track didn’t get reschuffled until turn 9!!! Which means that for 8 turns, I was without a vassal ... it was horrible ... 
The supply track also didn’t get updated until turn 6 or 7 .... very frustrating since I was on 1 or 2 from the start. 
A lot of it is bad luck from the Westeros cards and also the fact that Dorne had both IT and Raven, he was able to avoid these trackers to be updated.
As I mentioned, we enjoyed it but for 8 hours, it was frustrating ... a lot of back and forth without anything much happening. Not having a vassal for 8 turns when everyone else had one was ridiculous. I was boxed in a lot. I got up to 6VP on turn 9 but Dorne won with 7 VP on turn 10.
I guess we’ll try with Targaryen next time and I guess should try to up to 6 players but I am not looking forward to another 8 hours ...

379,,boardgames,"Hi All!

&amp;#x200B;

[Here's the link to my collection.](https://i.imgur.com/CTgDU8x.jpg) I always enjoy the discussions generated by the COMC posts, so I figured I'd finally do my own! I've been playing the ""classics"" most of my life, like Monopoly and Risk. About 2 years ago I started playing games at various friends' house like Dominion, Lords of Waterdeep, Pandemic, Codenames, and 7 Wonders. I was one of those people that didn't know board games existed beyond Monopoly and Risk. My wife and I and the couple that owns Dominion and Lords of Waterdeep decided that we should take turns buying games to play together, and I started with The Others (sort of a mistake!). May 2018 is when I first started really getting into the hobby when I decided I wanted to mess around designing my own board game with a work friend. As a part of my research into the concepts I was interested in, I started listening to the Dice Tower's Top Ten videos to learn about games in general and that opened up the world of board games to me. I eventually started listening to Shut Up and Sit Down podcasts on my drive to work, when mowing the lawn, etc. and the rest is kind of history. I've listened to their podcasts probably 3+ times each now and while I don't always agree with their opinions of games, I still think they're some of the best in the industry right now in terms of content.

I'm glad to have owned/played most of the games I currently own, but I'd probably get rid of a few, especially now that my bookshelf is running out of space. The bottom shelf is the aforementioned ""classics"" that sit there until I run out of room on my shelves. I'll get into dislikes later in the post. Some others mention their gaming table and gaming room in their COMC posts. I'll just briefly say I don't have a specific room or table, I just use the 6'x3' dinner table in my dining room. WOrks for basically everything up to TI4 (which requires side tables for each player).

&amp;#x200B;

*Favorites*

**7th Continent** \- This game is excellent. I didn't play any Choose Your Own Adventure games when I was a kid so its exciting to play something similar. I play 4-player with my wife and two friends and so far it's been a real hit. I have I think 8 curses from stretch goals on the Kickstarter and I have a feeling we will be playing this one for a long time. Kickstarted this before I really got deep into the hobby and the wait was worth it!

**Twilight Imperium** \- I've only played it once, but I'm a pretty big space nerd and the ""space opera"" thing is right up my alley. If I had friends that wanted to play it more often, I'd probably play it every weekend.

**Terraforming Mars** \- Just got to play this for the first time the other day, and again, as a space nerd, the theme is fantastic. I really enjoy engine builders in general and the vast number of well-themed cards available make me look forward to playing this more. Bought some plastic player board overlays to prevent things from shifting.

**Scythe** \- Scythe was the second game I bought after The Others, and I've probably played it the most. I like games that have multiple strategies to achieve the victory, and I enjoy variable player powers, so this is a great one for me. I rate it lower than the others because I'm not a fan of some of the mechanics like civilizations warping across the map, or the ""can't take the same action twice"" thing, but I can house rule those away if needed.

**7 Wonders Duel** \- Honorable mention, this and the Lord of the Rings deck builder are the only games I can get my wife to reliably play. She isn't a huge fan of board games, which is totally fine, but she enjoys this. She beats me every time too which is maddening but I've learned to live with it.

&amp;#x200B;

*Dislikes*

**Forbidden Island/Desert** \- Too simple for my taste (I lean towards heavier games).

**The Others** \- I can't stand games that are designed to be ""serious"" and resolve important things with dice rolls. I can understand losing a game to a bad dice roll in Dice Throne or Dice Forge, or using dice that can be manipulated like in Castles of Burgundy, but The Others feels like an exercise in futility sometimes. YMMV on this game for sure because it's heavily dependent on group dynamic, having played it quite a few times with my group.

**Catan** \- I've only played base Catan, and only with the beginner setup suggested in the rules. I'm told that making your own map, starting positions, and using expansions improve the fun. Definitely want to try that next time.

&amp;#x200B;

*Yet to Play*

**Spirit Island** \- Got this for my birthday 3 months ago and just haven't had a chance to play with a group. Expecting this to be a huge hit in my group where we have a strong quarterbacking problem.

**Above and Below** \- Bought on clearance and the theme looked fun, just haven't gotten it to the table yet.

**Endogenesis** \- Just got my Kickstarter edition a few days ago! Really looking forward to finding time to play it. The game was made by an active Redditor here /u/davidgoh2099 and his art design is killer.

**Unearth** \- Clearance buy, excellent artwork and enjoyable ""working"" dice rolling mechanics.

**Seafall** \- Clearance buy, legacy games are hard to get to the table. I have one couple that I want to play games like this with and they're busier than we are. Heard big backlash on this but I don't see it being hated by my group (finger's crossed).

**Red Scare** \- Clearance buy (Barnes &amp; Noble clearance can be great), my foray into hidden roles. Have played things like Secret Hitler and Avalon and this was like $4 on clearance, so I figured no harm if we all hate it.

**7th Continent: What Goes Up...** \- Just got my 7th Continent Kickstarter about 3 weeks ago, and we have been playing the first curse. As far as I know, the expansion stuff (specifically the balloon and barge) don't come into play until later curses.

&amp;#x200B;

*Kickstarter Preordered*

**On Mars** \- Kickstarter for On Mars just ended recently. Sounds like it'll only be a few months until it arrives. Never played a Lacerda game and I hear his games are complicated. I'm hoping the group I play with who prefers heavier games will really enjoy this one.

&amp;#x200B;

*Wishlist*

***Inis*** *-* This looks really fun to me and I don't have many strictly area control games. I love well-themed games as well and have only heard good things.

**Xia: Legends of a Drift System (and expansion)** \- On the other hand, I *have* heard some bad things about Xia but that they are improved with the expansion. Just gotta wait for another Kickstarter I guess.

**The Quest for El Dorado** \- Sounds like a fun Deck Builder. I really hate the dryness of Deck Builders like Dominion (and Lord of the Rings, to be fair), and like the idea of using my deck to do something.

&amp;#x200B;

*A quick rundown on the rest*

**Dice Forge** is the best-made game I've ever seen, and the gameplay is decent enough. **Fog of Love** didn't go well with my wife just because the role-playing thing isn't for her. **Onitama**, **Welcome to the Dungeon**, and **Among the Stars** are all fine, simple games. The third shelf has various games of the 6-8 range of BGG ratings. They're good with the right group. Really like **Santorini** for its chess-like feel and simplicity, yet decent variability in available strategies. **Starfall** is decently fun. **Escape Room The Game** would be cool but the device it comes with just didn't work.

&amp;#x200B;

*Other*

This is by no means an ad for the games I'm developing but I figured I'd add them to the end since they're a big part of the existence of my collection. I design these with /u/knighttim in our free time and while fun, it's hard to say if we'll ever be able to get them produced. Rating the ""completion"" of the games at the end of each.

**Festival of the Gladiator** \- 2-6 player card drafting + deck building character-builder. Like I mentioned before, I like deck builders where you do something with your deck other than using it to do more deck building. Players fight each other or monsters in a mythological Greco-roman colosseum. Rules 100%, Cards 99%, Art 75%.

**Ascendance of the Archmage** \- 2-6 player Twilight Imperium style map with smaller hexes and cubes for units. No dice combat. Focused on building resource economies (euro style), constructing buildings for new worker placement slots, networking with allies (and foes), and using spells in war. Rules 95%, Cards 5%, Art 0%.

**Pan's Garden** \- 4 player area control + asymmetric player powers (sort of like Root). Newest one in-work, so not much to speak of. Rules 40%, Cards 0%, Art 0%.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/CTgDU8x.jpg""&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the link to my collection.&lt;/a&gt; I always enjoy the discussions generated by the COMC posts, so I figured I&amp;#39;d finally do my own! I&amp;#39;ve been playing the &amp;quot;classics&amp;quot; most of my life, like Monopoly and Risk. About 2 years ago I started playing games at various friends&amp;#39; house like Dominion, Lords of Waterdeep, Pandemic, Codenames, and 7 Wonders. I was one of those people that didn&amp;#39;t know board games existed beyond Monopoly and Risk. My wife and I and the couple that owns Dominion and Lords of Waterdeep decided that we should take turns buying games to play together, and I started with The Others (sort of a mistake!). May 2018 is when I first started really getting into the hobby when I decided I wanted to mess around designing my own board game with a work friend. As a part of my research into the concepts I was interested in, I started listening to the Dice Tower&amp;#39;s Top Ten videos to learn about games in general and that opened up the world of board games to me. I eventually started listening to Shut Up and Sit Down podcasts on my drive to work, when mowing the lawn, etc. and the rest is kind of history. I&amp;#39;ve listened to their podcasts probably 3+ times each now and while I don&amp;#39;t always agree with their opinions of games, I still think they&amp;#39;re some of the best in the industry right now in terms of content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m glad to have owned/played most of the games I currently own, but I&amp;#39;d probably get rid of a few, especially now that my bookshelf is running out of space. The bottom shelf is the aforementioned &amp;quot;classics&amp;quot; that sit there until I run out of room on my shelves. I&amp;#39;ll get into dislikes later in the post. Some others mention their gaming table and gaming room in their COMC posts. I&amp;#39;ll just briefly say I don&amp;#39;t have a specific room or table, I just use the 6&amp;#39;x3&amp;#39; dinner table in my dining room. WOrks for basically everything up to TI4 (which requires side tables for each player).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Favorites&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7th Continent&lt;/strong&gt; - This game is excellent. I didn&amp;#39;t play any Choose Your Own Adventure games when I was a kid so its exciting to play something similar. I play 4-player with my wife and two friends and so far it&amp;#39;s been a real hit. I have I think 8 curses from stretch goals on the Kickstarter and I have a feeling we will be playing this one for a long time. Kickstarted this before I really got deep into the hobby and the wait was worth it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twilight Imperium&lt;/strong&gt; - I&amp;#39;ve only played it once, but I&amp;#39;m a pretty big space nerd and the &amp;quot;space opera&amp;quot; thing is right up my alley. If I had friends that wanted to play it more often, I&amp;#39;d probably play it every weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terraforming Mars&lt;/strong&gt; - Just got to play this for the first time the other day, and again, as a space nerd, the theme is fantastic. I really enjoy engine builders in general and the vast number of well-themed cards available make me look forward to playing this more. Bought some plastic player board overlays to prevent things from shifting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scythe&lt;/strong&gt; - Scythe was the second game I bought after The Others, and I&amp;#39;ve probably played it the most. I like games that have multiple strategies to achieve the victory, and I enjoy variable player powers, so this is a great one for me. I rate it lower than the others because I&amp;#39;m not a fan of some of the mechanics like civilizations warping across the map, or the &amp;quot;can&amp;#39;t take the same action twice&amp;quot; thing, but I can house rule those away if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 Wonders Duel&lt;/strong&gt; - Honorable mention, this and the Lord of the Rings deck builder are the only games I can get my wife to reliably play. She isn&amp;#39;t a huge fan of board games, which is totally fine, but she enjoys this. She beats me every time too which is maddening but I&amp;#39;ve learned to live with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dislikes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forbidden Island/Desert&lt;/strong&gt; - Too simple for my taste (I lean towards heavier games).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Others&lt;/strong&gt; - I can&amp;#39;t stand games that are designed to be &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot; and resolve important things with dice rolls. I can understand losing a game to a bad dice roll in Dice Throne or Dice Forge, or using dice that can be manipulated like in Castles of Burgundy, but The Others feels like an exercise in futility sometimes. YMMV on this game for sure because it&amp;#39;s heavily dependent on group dynamic, having played it quite a few times with my group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catan&lt;/strong&gt; - I&amp;#39;ve only played base Catan, and only with the beginner setup suggested in the rules. I&amp;#39;m told that making your own map, starting positions, and using expansions improve the fun. Definitely want to try that next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yet to Play&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spirit Island&lt;/strong&gt; - Got this for my birthday 3 months ago and just haven&amp;#39;t had a chance to play with a group. Expecting this to be a huge hit in my group where we have a strong quarterbacking problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Above and Below&lt;/strong&gt; - Bought on clearance and the theme looked fun, just haven&amp;#39;t gotten it to the table yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endogenesis&lt;/strong&gt; - Just got my Kickstarter edition a few days ago! Really looking forward to finding time to play it. The game was made by an active Redditor here &lt;a href=""/u/davidgoh2099""&gt;/u/davidgoh2099&lt;/a&gt; and his art design is killer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unearth&lt;/strong&gt; - Clearance buy, excellent artwork and enjoyable &amp;quot;working&amp;quot; dice rolling mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seafall&lt;/strong&gt; - Clearance buy, legacy games are hard to get to the table. I have one couple that I want to play games like this with and they&amp;#39;re busier than we are. Heard big backlash on this but I don&amp;#39;t see it being hated by my group (finger&amp;#39;s crossed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red Scare&lt;/strong&gt; - Clearance buy (Barnes &amp;amp; Noble clearance can be great), my foray into hidden roles. Have played things like Secret Hitler and Avalon and this was like $4 on clearance, so I figured no harm if we all hate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7th Continent: What Goes Up...&lt;/strong&gt; - Just got my 7th Continent Kickstarter about 3 weeks ago, and we have been playing the first curse. As far as I know, the expansion stuff (specifically the balloon and barge) don&amp;#39;t come into play until later curses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kickstarter Preordered&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Mars&lt;/strong&gt; - Kickstarter for On Mars just ended recently. Sounds like it&amp;#39;ll only be a few months until it arrives. Never played a Lacerda game and I hear his games are complicated. I&amp;#39;m hoping the group I play with who prefers heavier games will really enjoy this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wishlist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;-&lt;/em&gt; This looks really fun to me and I don&amp;#39;t have many strictly area control games. I love well-themed games as well and have only heard good things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xia: Legends of a Drift System (and expansion)&lt;/strong&gt; - On the other hand, I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; heard some bad things about Xia but that they are improved with the expansion. Just gotta wait for another Kickstarter I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Quest for El Dorado&lt;/strong&gt; - Sounds like a fun Deck Builder. I really hate the dryness of Deck Builders like Dominion (and Lord of the Rings, to be fair), and like the idea of using my deck to do something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A quick rundown on the rest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dice Forge&lt;/strong&gt; is the best-made game I&amp;#39;ve ever seen, and the gameplay is decent enough. &lt;strong&gt;Fog of Love&lt;/strong&gt; didn&amp;#39;t go well with my wife just because the role-playing thing isn&amp;#39;t for her. &lt;strong&gt;Onitama&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Welcome to the Dungeon&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Among the Stars&lt;/strong&gt; are all fine, simple games. The third shelf has various games of the 6-8 range of BGG ratings. They&amp;#39;re good with the right group. Really like &lt;strong&gt;Santorini&lt;/strong&gt; for its chess-like feel and simplicity, yet decent variability in available strategies. &lt;strong&gt;Starfall&lt;/strong&gt; is decently fun. &lt;strong&gt;Escape Room The Game&lt;/strong&gt; would be cool but the device it comes with just didn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is by no means an ad for the games I&amp;#39;m developing but I figured I&amp;#39;d add them to the end since they&amp;#39;re a big part of the existence of my collection. I design these with &lt;a href=""/u/knighttim""&gt;/u/knighttim&lt;/a&gt; in our free time and while fun, it&amp;#39;s hard to say if we&amp;#39;ll ever be able to get them produced. Rating the &amp;quot;completion&amp;quot; of the games at the end of each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Festival of the Gladiator&lt;/strong&gt; - 2-6 player card drafting + deck building character-builder. Like I mentioned before, I like deck builders where you do something with your deck other than using it to do more deck building. Players fight each other or monsters in a mythological Greco-roman colosseum. Rules 100%, Cards 99%, Art 75%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ascendance of the Archmage&lt;/strong&gt; - 2-6 player Twilight Imperium style map with smaller hexes and cubes for units. No dice combat. Focused on building resource economies (euro style), constructing buildings for new worker placement slots, networking with allies (and foes), and using spells in war. Rules 95%, Cards 5%, Art 0%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pan&amp;#39;s Garden&lt;/strong&gt; - 4 player area control + asymmetric player powers (sort of like Root). Newest one in-work, so not much to speak of. Rules 40%, Cards 0%, Art 0%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

380,,boardgames,"I've played Star Wars Rebellion 10-15 times now, and I've enjoyed each and every game. The issue is, I'm beginning to enjoy it less and less because of a flaw in the game. 

To me, combat seems like complete tedium at this point. The first few games it was so much fun to Chuck dice and see all the tactic cards, playing out epic climactic battles. At this point for me, the theme is beginning to fade, and the mechanics are more apparent to me now. 

Combat just seems... Repetitive? It's a chore at this point. I play Twilight Imperium, and in that game, the space combat has to be won first, then the ground combat. One of my many issues with Rebellions combat system is that I only have to bring a single assault carrier an some strong ground troops into a system if I want to take the planet. Sure, my assault carrier will be obliterated, but my troops will get on the ground safely. In this way, it makes me feel like amassing space troops (especially as the empire, who will always have the superior number of troops), is pointless. I'll beat the rebels pretty easily because I make troops so much easier as I start with more systems. 

Next, the tactic cards. This is a complete mess to me. Having to shuffle and deal little deck every single time I want to start a new combat is so boring. Yes, it makes certain leaders stronger in combat than others (which I appreciate), but there isn't much variety, and it feels like a cheap move so that the same dice can be used on skill checks and combat. 

I have sort of burned out on the combat in this game, especially playing war games like Root and Sekigahara (which are not the same genre as Rebellion, but Root has a 5 second combat system, and Sekigahara is so strategic in combat). 

What have other fans of this game done to keep combat exciting? Does the expansion fix it? What should I do differently, if anything?

381,,boardgames,"As a new player to the board game scene, looking up games to play in a vast variety of genres and the amount that are available is quite daunting.

Games played in the past are the general family games; monopoly, scrabble and payday types but years ago dabbled in Talisman as a young teen and loved it but went back to video games. Over the years interest in video games just become less and less but recently the general family games have been hitting the dining table but wanting a new challenge.

Income is good but not to a point where its like oh this game looks awesome but a little pricey but order it, its not that great, put it on the shelf, lets look for another.

So when you started out, how did you used to narrow down which game to buy? 

After purchasing a few games did you make tweaks to how you decided, What were they and how do you now?

Also another factor in purchasing a game, is backing a game, either through Kickstarter. Maybe wrong but seems a lot of table top games get kickstarters and stay as only kickstarter games. 

Should a new player in table top games even be looking at backing games?

Do you use the same process you use to determine if you should back it as if you were purchasing a retail game?

[BGG collection](https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/Niarlat)

(Not pictured here are all 12 Kingdom Death expansions and 10 MtG Ravnica Guild Kits.)

The game that brought me into the hobby was **Kingdom Death**. I was an avid PC gamer and when Kickstarter became popular I enjoyed looking for cool projects. Imagine my surprise when I found some strange game with miniatures among top trending projects. I decided to check it out and was absolutely blown away. I knew I wanted to get into this ""Kingdom Death"" but I decided that 100$ is too much for a game that I likely won't ever play with anyone. And then there were all the expansions that made the whole thing unreasonable.

Well, today I have a group of 25-30 people to play with, nice boardgame collection and a fully backed project for Kingdom Death 2nd printing. Never was I so happy to turn out wrong!

The first game I bought was **Dixit** and it still sits comfortably as the 'chill' game when you need to vent after heated meetup.

It is really hard to name favorites but I really wish I could play more **Captain Sonar**, **Battlestar Galactica**, **Eclipse** and **Vast**!

My biggest letdowns are **TIME Stories**, **Mansions of Madness 2nd ed**. and **Dead of Winter**.

Recently I discovered math trade and got rid of:

 *  **Smash Up!** (too long and complex for a filler, too shallow for a main spot)
 *  **Pandemic** (didn't like it at all, felt like it's really a solo game with some characters strictly better then others)
 *  **Betrayal at House On The Hill** (it was a hit 3 years ago, rarely played nowadays. Has an option of returning as Legacy variant.)
 *  **Smallworld** (can't pinpoint what I didn't like but it felt bland)
 *  **Mage Knight** (to make space for an Ultimate Edition, the game is amazing!)

Overall, I think things I like the most in games are player interaction, theme and some unique features.

I would love to expand my collection into some categories and mechanics that are missing. Namely, I am looking into worker placement but find that most games in this category don't actually DO anything with placing the worker except for giving you resource X or some Victory Points. I recently discovered **Dominant Species** as a game in this genre I would maybe like but still not sure.

Any comments, questions and recommendations are welcome!

&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pandemic&lt;/strong&gt; (didn&amp;#39;t like it at all, felt like it&amp;#39;s really a solo game with some characters strictly better then others)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Betrayal at House On The Hill&lt;/strong&gt; (it was a hit 3 years ago, rarely played nowadays. Has an option of returning as Legacy variant.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Smallworld&lt;/strong&gt; (can&amp;#39;t pinpoint what I didn&amp;#39;t like but it felt bland)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Mage Knight&lt;/strong&gt; (to make space for an Ultimate Edition, the game is amazing!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think things I like the most in games are player interaction, theme and some unique features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to expand my collection into some categories and mechanics that are missing. Namely, I am looking into worker placement but find that most games in this category don&amp;#39;t actually DO anything with placing the worker except for giving you resource X or some Victory Points. I recently discovered &lt;strong&gt;Dominant Species&lt;/strong&gt; as a game in this genre I would maybe like but still not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any comments, questions and recommendations are welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Kingdom Death, Gloomhaven and Twillight Imperium on picture are lids only!&lt;/p&gt;

386,,boardgames,"##About This List

On on near the beginning of every month, I compile the game ratings that members of the Redditors Guild on Board Game Geek have given the games they've played (plus a little Bayseian statistical sugar) and I compare the difference in this list with the previous list. This is indicative of the change in sentiment towards these games in the past month. Maybe. Probably not. I don't know, don't take it too seriously, but it's fun to put together and I hope you have fun arguing about it.

(If you wish to join the Redditors Guild and make sure your ratings are included, there's a link at the very bottom of the post.)

&lt;p&gt;On on near the beginning of every month, I compile the game ratings that members of the Redditors Guild on Board Game Geek have given the games they&amp;#39;ve played (plus a little Bayseian statistical sugar) and I compare the difference in this list with the previous list. This is indicative of the change in sentiment towards these games in the past month. Maybe. Probably not. I don&amp;#39;t know, don&amp;#39;t take it too seriously, but it&amp;#39;s fun to put together and I hope you have fun arguing about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If you wish to join the Redditors Guild and make sure your ratings are included, there&amp;#39;s a link at the very bottom of the post.)&lt;/p&gt;

387,,boardgames,"Hi, reddit boardgamers. 

My bg circle and I are looking to shift some games from table top to app, where we can play remotely. Furthermore, we're looking to gravitate towards app for those games where it's one person turns at a time and then it's just a lot of waiting. 

We've done this with Lord/Waterdeep and we love it. It's a game we can play indefinitely. 

We want to do it with a couple more boardgames and the next one we're looking at is Potion Explosion. I just have a few questions for anyone that has played it since I've haven't used an Asmondee Digital app before: 

(1) does the game cross multiple os (iOS and Android)? 
(2) is the game compatible with phones or are tablets needed? 
(3) if it is compatible with phones, is it manageable given the small screen real estate some phones have? 
(4) is there an add-friend system where you and your friends can set up private matches? Or is this game pass-and-play multiplayer only? 
(5) (probably the most important question) - if there is an add-friend and set up private match options, are there push notifications to tell you when it's your turn and if so, is it reliable? 

Thanks.

392,,boardgames,"My wife and I have played two games so far. First game the empire won by destroying he planet that had the rebel base with the Death Star. Second game rebels won by surviving until the 6th or so round.  

This is the biggest game I’ve played, I’m still having trouble seeing the big picture in some ways and knowing what strategies are good. If that makes sense. Some cards just seem pointless. For example, the rebel sabotage card. The Empire has a card that lets them remove a sabotage marker. Wife (Empire) would play the mission every time so I if I played hype sabotage card it was a pointless mission. This makes it very difficult to complete that one objective that requires 3 sabotage markers to be out.  

I guess my questions are: what are some goo strategies for both sides?

First game the empire won by destroying he planet that had the rebel base with the Death Star. Second game rebels won by surviving until the 6th or so round.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the biggest game I’ve played, I’m still having trouble seeing the big picture in some ways and knowing what strategies are good. If that makes sense. Some cards just seem pointless. For example, the rebel sabotage card. The Empire has a card that lets them remove a sabotage marker. Wife (Empire) would play the mission every time so I if I played hype sabotage card it was a pointless mission. This makes it very difficult to complete that one objective that requires 3 sabotage markers to be out.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess my questions are: what are some goo strategies for both sides?

398,,boardgames,"I’m almost always the one owning and teaching the games in my group, which I enjoy just fine.  I like to iron out the kinks in my teaching style that hinder player enjoyment, so here’s one that has been bugging me for a while.

Many games have specific generic pieces, chits, cards or conditions that have no inherent effect.  They can’t be spent as a resource or used to perform or modify any action.  These pieces are just *there* until another card ability calls on them.  Something like, “If [player] has [piece], he discards a card.”  

I am looking for a snappy term to describe this kind of mechanism in games.  When teaching like 9 games to family over vacation last week, I realized that my players often got hung up on bits like this; many games refer to these pieces offhandedly like you should know what they mean, so new players become anxious about the dark spot in their knowledge.  I would like to “skip over” that anxiety when teaching by using a generic term that can describe them in any game - something that makes my regular player group say, “ohhh, gotcha.”

A prime example would be Virus Counters in *Netrunner*.  These chits produce no inherent effect, but the cards that call to produce them ascribe effects to them (usually).  Virus counters mean nothing for either player without context.  Same for agenda counters, power counters, and tags, sort of.

Root has a decent example in Items.  For most players, items have no inherent effect; their icons are only meaningful due to the game’s scarcity of items.  For the Vagabond, the faction board transforms meaningless chits into an entire gameplay system.  Every unique piece gets a unique action or provides a boost.  So these pieces *kind of* fit the bill.  

  (You could also say the Star die faces in King of NY fit the bill since they are contexualized only by the Superstar card, but that’s, uh, dicey.)

Yesterday while playing Citadel for the first time, I  got assassinated and got robbed in 1st-2nd turn. It feel terrible. It made me want to leave but I did not want to ruin everyone else fun so I take a deep breath and keep playing. Unfortuanately, my friend next to me kept mocking and trashtalking which, I guess it is kinda normal but instantly get on my nerve. It made me throw cards in my hand away and walked out of the table. I felt sorry and apologize them almost instantly but the damage is done. I ruined everyone else fun because I keep playing instead of leaving which will ruin everyone else fun as well. 

Now, it got into my list of the game I am not going to touch again.

I recently picked up a copy of Charterstone during a sale, but I'm struggling with the legacy aspect: I admit to being very reluctant to the idea of permanently altering or even destroying game components.

The main issue is that now that I've bought it, I want to play all 12 games of it to get the full experience. However, I don't know if that's going to happen since I don't have a group of dedicated hardcore boardgamers that are guaranteed to play it until the end of the campaign, so I'm afraid some players will drop out for various reasons, leaving me with an unusable half-played game.

https://imgur.com/a/uQLGlTL

How long have I been involved in the hobby? I started collecting back Pandemic first hit the scene, was super hyped when Z-Man was crowd funding Agricola, dove into Arkham 2nd Ed. but then things started to fall off when I couldn't really find anyone to play with. Fast forward to about early 2016 when I was able to find a great group of people willing to put up with my board gaming, now we get together and play about once a week.

What would I change about my collection if I could? Honestly not much, while there is lots of my shelf that doesn't get a ton of play anymore it's all part of the evolution that got me to the board games I play today. Gloomhaven is probably the number one game that I own that I should play but have no intentions of ever playing again. I've played it twice, I can completely see the brilliance behind it and that it's an amazing game, but just due to the setup/teardown time (I even built a foamcore organizer for it to try and help) and the amount of rule finickyness - I just never plan to touch it again.

One of my biggest board gaming mistakes is waiting too long to try an 18XX game! I thought they'd be so technical and dry, I was put off by the long playtimes and intimidating rulesets but after I finally tried one our group is hooked, 1830 hits the table more now than any other game by a pretty large margin. Anyone that even thinks they'd like an economic/stock market based game needs needs needs to try an 18XX. Don't let the look of them put you off, they're dynamic, cut throat and more exciting than most games out there.

I have cool stuff on the horizon! Anxiously awaiting games like Pax Pamir 2nd to arrive, Age of Steam reprint, Trickerion and a few others.

Some of the old games like HeroQuest are from my childhood (just found a second copy for $5.99 at Value Village last week) but a lot of the random stuff in there are second hand store finds or stuff I've intentionally collected over time.

Ive just started board gaming and game solo and have looked up possible games on this very forum. I decided to order this game as I like the theme of Victorian london and the ripper cases are fascinating to me also. 

First I have to say what an absolutely beautiful box/contents this game is. Wow.  I had seen reviews or unboxings on YouTube but in person it is just womderful! Lavish with period details and thematic illustrations.

I played case 5 as it recommends and scored 100% on all the questions, except I followed every led and and that put me at -135pts leaving me with a total of +5pts. I really enjoyed playing and it was very very difficult. I even liked the quip at the end about mendels peas from sherlock (I remembered such from my genetics studies.) 

I was hesitant to purchase as the cases are one time only but each case works out at £3.10 and for that I get a lovely booklet, a newspaper, a story and 4 hours (in my case) of pondering and pontificating about who did what lol. 

Well worth the money and I'm looking forward to the other cases in the set along with trying out some of the other boxes such as Carlton house and the soon to be released baker Street irregulars.

440,,boardgames,"  

After 2 years of working on my board game ""Werewolf vs. Vampire"", I would like to offer to write a developer diary for the game.

It's about all the small steps after the offer - to the finished product including shipping.

My question is, are you interested?

Leave me a comment.

&amp;#x200B;

I started to keep the diary on Facebook and so I already listed the first 5 days here. If you like this, I would post more diary entries here once a week.

&amp;#x200B;

As previous knowledge is still important that I had a campaign on Kickstarter, which I had to stop. Why, you can read here:

## Day 1

Finally I agreed with a developing company  on the production settings. They are going to send me templates for the different items.

## Day 2

I have received the following question:  
 Why did you cancel the last Kickstarter campaign?

**The short answer**  
 3D Minis

**Detail answer**  
 In the first campaign, a lot of people asked about my minis. So, in order to do everything right in the second campaign, I offered minis.  
 I had to stop the last Kickstarter campaign because only 3 people wanted them.   
 Therefore, I was in a dilemma.

&amp;#x200B;

If I get 2 Minis produced, there is a one-time amount of about 2,300 euros.   
 Even if everyone buys miniatures this costs about 10 Euro on Kickstarter (5€ + Kickstarter costs + financial institution + returns).

&amp;#x200B;

But for 10 Euro apparently only 3 people were willed to buy these. So I would not only have to cover for the costs for 300 games, but also the costs for 497 minis.

## Day 3

I told you that on Kickstarter not all supporters wanted miniatures for 10 Euro.

At the same time, it was not possible for me to keep this offer for 3 bidders.

&amp;#x200B;

But now to the solution for the miniatures problem.

Since the campaign a lot of time has gone by and I have been looking a lot for 3D miniatures solutions. For a long time, I didn't find anything that met my quality standards.

A few approaches:

\- Smallest production quantity: the price per miniature is then 7.50€ So even more money and even fewer supporters who want to have the product then.

\- DIY 3D printing (filament): Absolutely not. Apart from the fact that the people, who try to get good results of 3D printing spend a LITTLE more time on this task - the result is not sufficient for me. Of course, you can get better results, but only by using sandpaper and a LOT of time.

&amp;#x200B;

Then by chance I became aware of another printing process.

&amp;#x200B;

From time to time I enter search terms at different platforms and on a wonderful Wednesday evening this was '3D printing' on Kickstarter. The result was a printing process that I hadn't really followed until then, as the printers were at 2,300 Euros.

Now the price was below 300 Euros. So I sent a mail to the 3D nerd I trust and asked if that could be good and promptly received the answer ""No, they start at over 2k Euros"".

After I had sent the link, the statement changed into: ""Wow, that sounds pretty good.""

&amp;#x200B;

So, I supported the printer. But everyone who is involved with Kickstarter also knows that many projects in the field of technology failed.

&amp;#x200B;

But I wanted to know more about it and have really been involved with the printing process in detail. And look at that, on Amazon there was an almost equivalent printer with a 20 Euro discount and one material for free. Another 2 days later I ordered the printer.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I say:

\- Easy to use

\- Real fun

\- Super results (professional)

&amp;#x200B;

I then took the first results with me to my 3D friend and because of the miniatures I printed out with them, another printer was sold immediately.

&amp;#x200B;

The printouts so far look so good that I am convinced that I can produce small quantities at at least the same price.

&amp;#x200B;

That way I won't run into the same trap again for the next campaign and can even offer a little highlight. But that won't be revealed yet.

## Day 4

Today I would like to say something about the decision on the production quantity.

&amp;#x200B;

A large part of the decision was taken from me:

&amp;#x200B;

When you produce a game, there's always a minimum quantity that you have to buy.

For most of the manufacturers I wrote to, this is 500. Others want to sell at least 1500 pieces.

&amp;#x200B;

I've read in many forums that at the end of a Kickstarter campaign you can sell the same amount through other distribution channels. That should then include Amazon, Ebay, dealers, game events and this should also be the end of sales.

&amp;#x200B;

In my first campaign, I had oriented myself to other titles and wanted to recoup production costs as much as possible. Therefore, I had specified 8,000€ as target mark. That would have been about 365 supporters. But I landed at 80 (some jumped off towards the end).

With the improved second campaign I had to break off with almost 60 supporters. I think I could have got 120 supporters here.

&amp;#x200B;

So, let's stay with 120 supporters. If I could sell that much again in post-sale, I should make 240 pieces.

&amp;#x200B;

The temptation to produce more is huge, because the different production quantities don't cost so much at the end of the day.

&amp;#x200B;

When I compared the offers, the following came out.

500 pieces á 15€ - 7.500€

1.500 pcs á 7€ - 10.500€ each

&amp;#x200B;

But since I would already have 260 games on stock at the moment, I don't have to spend 3.000€ to fill the stock completely with them.

&amp;#x200B;

I even found a company that would have produced 260 games for me. 

Now guess what it would have cost: right - 7.500 Euro.

## Day 5

Today I would like to talk about the different offers I got for 10-sided dice. There are always surprising differences, which can be clarified, but are by no means obvious.

   
 

This statement can be used almost 1:1 for all other components.

   
 

For 500 pieces:

   
 

ID..each…development cost

A....0.18…………. € 260 € 

B....0.13…………...€ 0 €

C....0.54…………...€ 0 €

   
 

That looks very clearly like offer B. 

Only by explicit asking I found this (after several requests😊).

   
 

What does development cost mean in dice production?

For dice ""templates"" have to be made. These are good for 5,000 dice. A new tepmlate must be made, even if only the colors are minimally different.

   
 

And why do some of them manage without development costs?

They don't. Offer B is only based on the assumption that the manufacturer still has such similar dice in stock (someone else had perhaps only taken 500 of the 5,000 and so dice are left). 

But since I want to have a certain color combination, a template has to be made.

   
 

But why does offer C have no development costs?

That is simply math: 

Offer A) 500 pcs. x 0.18 € + 260 € = 350€

Offer C) 500 pcs. x 0.70 € + 000 € = 350 €

Offer C has therefore simply passed on the development costs to each individual die.

&amp;#x200B;

446,,boardgames,"Let me be a jerk for a moment and criticize one of my most beloved game reviewers, SUSD. They were the ones that re-ignited my passion for board games  with their fantastic review of Azul (Paul!). They are always entertaining and often include fascinating segments in their reviews, like that time they discussed orientalism and the place of women (that is, none) in Istanbul. Their recent podcast featuring the book ""Top 10 Games You Can Play In Your Head, By Yourself"" was the best and most original gaming content I've heard in a long while. Even my reddit name is an homage to one of their reviews. That said, something about them has been nagging me for some time and I just had to voice it out. It probably bugs me more because I like them so much.

They so often get the rules of their games wrong.

It occurs so often that I can't help but notice it. It happened for Gugong recently: they said game was good but a bit underwhelming, and a commenter on their site wrote ""You were using the double servant wrong"", to which Quinns replied "" I checked the rules on this *three time*s and still apparently got it wrong?"". Of course it makes you wonder: would they have liked the game better if they played it right? Probably. Maybe? And now almost 100k viewers saw the ""underwhelmed"" video review, and in the currently saturated games market, this means most of those people are probably going to pass on the game.

It happened with their playthrough of Gloomhaven. A Youtube commenter wrote a list of 10 (!) rules errors they made in the video. But didn't Matt spend hours and hours creating a wonderfully produced 35 minutes review of the game about a year before? Did he do all the playtesting, script writing, video shooting and editing, the review was seen by 675k people... and he had the rules wrong all along? Did he just forget them?

This happens with very simple games too. Have a look at their Gin Rummy video, even then Quinns makes lots of rules mistakes. Which are corrected in text overlays, but then they appear so often that it becomes hard to follow. And as an internet jerk who comfortably enjoys your free content and hard labour, let me ask a very naive question: for a video where the whole point is to teach the game, for a simple game that you just taught in 5 minutes not counting a bit of banter... why not just reshoot the whole thing on the spot and make it right? What's the point of a rules video where the rules are wrong?

It happened again with the very simple press-your-luck game ""That’s Not Lemonade"" (18 cards and a few cups) they described as being not very good in their podcast. In the next one they noted the designer had contacted them saying that they had missed a central rule of the game, which made it way less dumb than they had presented it. How could they still get such a simple game wrong, especially when they feature it on their podcast? And then I remembered them saying how they played Skull wrong for a long time at first, with people bidding free-for-all instead of in order. Which luckily for this other games publisher made the game more fun for them this time. But when you cannot grasp the rules of a game like Skull, of course you're going to make mistakes with Gugong and Gloomhaven.

Granted, most of these games, they acknowledged the errors on their website or in a follow-up podcast. And of course it is hard to get rules right when you have to try so many in a week. Errors happen of course, it's fine. But then in this case it looks like it's becoming systematic. I can't help but get annoyed, because those recurring mistakes make me doubt the value of all their other very entertaining reviews. Especially for games with complex rules like Lisboa and Root, and for games they say they did not enjoy. The writing is top-notch, the video production stellar... but if I can't trust the review is it worth it?

Many of my friends who play occasionaly don't care much about rules. When they open their brand new game, they skim the rules to get to play as fast as possible. And who cares, right? Isn't the goal to have fun? They are surprised when they play the same game with me and the rules are way different than they remember. SUSD has also been focused from the start on having fun with your friends, and that is for the best. But as game reviewers with hundreds of thousands of viewers, shouldn't they be held to a higher standard?

452,,boardgames,"***The hottest roll-and-write dice game just became a more satisfying and deeper experience!***

In recent years, the genre of roll-and-write games has been enjoying something of a resurgence. Despite its haters, games like Yahtzee (1956) have always been popular. So rather than criticize this old chestnut for its faults or limitations, why not piggyback on its success, and use it as a stepping stone to introduce fans to the newer generation of roll-and-write games? This class includes the award-winning Qwixx (2012), which has everyone involved even on other player's turns.  Then comes **That's Pretty Clever** (2018), which is a much more meaty game geared to satisfy gamers. It has made a big splash, and has proven very popular. Many gamers will insist that it is their favourite roll-and-write game ever! Like most dice games, it's fast, fun, and addictive, but it adds elements of real strategy and depth. 

And now the following year, along comes its sequel, **Twice As Clever** (2019), with both games being brought to the American market by publisher Stronghold Games. Like the original, this new title comes from designer Wolfgang Warsch, and is a dice-rolling game for 1-4 players, playable in under half an hour. 

**Game-play**

The rules of Twice As Clever are basically the same as That's Pretty Clever, as you're rolling and re-rolling dice, marking off squares in your scoring grid. What's different, however, is a new silver die that lets you score with multiple dice, and also a new power. The result is an even more deep and strategic game! If you liked That's Pretty Clever, but wanted an even greater challenge, then Twice As Clever is the perfect game for you. You'll love this just as much - or if the title is any indication, perhaps twice as much!

**Impressions**

That's Pretty Clever was rightly praised as being a terrific roll-and-write game. What gave it appeal to gamers was that it offered so much more than standard dice-rolling fillers like Yahtzee. Now Twice As Clever (2019) has come along, offering an even more meaty experience. It continues the successful formula of the original, and if you really enjoyed that, you're likely to enjoy this too. The basic concept that made the original game great has been retained, and what has been added are some new scoring possibilities and features. These make it an even more thoughtful and satisfying experience for those who like to really chew on their decisions.

If you're only going to get one of these games, you should make your decision based on your preferred level of complexity and depth. Twice As Clever certainly offers the deeper experience of the two, so if it's a more strategic and meaty game that you are looking for, then this is likely going to be the one you enjoy the most. Even then, you will probably get the most out of it by starting with That's Pretty Clever, playing that over and over until you're ready for a new challenge, and only then moving up to Twice As Clever. On the other hand if you're more likely to enjoy a lighter-medium weight game, then That's Pretty Clever is probably the game to get anyway. While its depth might scare off some gateway gamers, it can also be ideal for the purpose of bringing newcomers to the fold. Either way, That's Pretty Clever is the place that almost everyone should start with, and if you really love it, then you can always move up to Twice As Clever when you want to step up the level of complexity, while offering more of the same style of game-play.

**Recommendation**

Both of these games are great additions to the gaming market. It's wonderful to see the roll-and-write genre being invigorated and populated by titles that don't sacrifice depth of thought. While light dice-rolling fillers like Yahtzee will always be popular in the mass market, it's good to see that there are solid options in the roll-and-write category for gamers as well. And you can't do much better than That's Pretty Clever and its sequel Twice As Clever. Especially for gamers, I recommend them both very highly!

[Part 5 (Final) - Iterate, Iterate, Iterate](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/cakhsi/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_5_final_iterate_iterate/)

After a few play-testing sessions and changing the design quite a bit, I decided that I was far enough along that I could write up a post for Reddit gauging the interest in a series of “diaries” on what I’d done thus far.

I also posted it on Boardgamegeek.com. I was surprised to see that several of the designers of  the game responded to my original post (turns out I shouldn’t have been surprised, they comment quite often and are very interactive with the Spirit Island player-base). One in particular was Ted Vessenes. His comment sent my mind racing on how I could have done this better:

&gt;I would break down the process like this:  
&gt;  
&gt;**Part 1:** Name and thematic description  
&gt;  
&gt;**Part 2:** Special rule and play style description  
&gt;  
&gt;**Part 3:** Innates  
&gt;  
&gt;**Part 4:** Unique Powers  
&gt;  
&gt;**Part 5:** Growth  
&gt;  
&gt;**Part 6:** Structural testing (""Does it even work?"")  
&gt;  
&gt;**Part 7:** Coherence testing (""Do all the pieces contribute?"")  
&gt;  
&gt;**Part 8:** Balance testing (""Is power level appropriate?"")  
&gt;  
&gt;You might notice that when I choose to respond to custom designs, I'll almost always comment on only the first thing in this list that I think needs design. It's because these things affect each other in layers-- changing the special rule will change what Innate Powers  you want, which can change what unique powers you want. But changing a unique power only rarely makes you want to change special rules.

His comment about how each part affects all the other parts in layers is what struck me. Things needed to be cemented down in a previous part before you could reasonably start on the next part. So I went back down the list with my Spirit and quickly found things that needed to change:

**Assessment:**

* **Part 1 - Name/Description:**
   * Name: Shifting Desert’s Gaping Maw
   * Thematic Description: A Sand Spirit that draws in intruders and devours them
      * Elemental Affinity: Major/Minor/Other
* **Part 2 - Special Rule(s):**
   * Only place Presence in Sands.
      * I was fine with this, I like the limited range aspect of the Spirit, it gives it some obvious flaws that it will have to find a way around in the future.
   * Gather when Presence is placed.
      * Here’s where we run into some problems. It was obvious from the first play-test that this Special Rule was too powerful. The thematic fantasy of the Spirit was already being fulfilled by the second Innate Power, so I didn’t need to add it into the Special Rules as well.
   * Convert Plant and Water into Sun
      * I liked the idea, but was a little strange in execution. It also meant that my Spirit could never help with certain Events that arose during play. That felt bad, so this needed to be changed as well.

So as you can see, I was stopped on only step 2 of 8, revealing to me that I needed to work on the fundamentals once more before I moved on to the actual number-tweaking and other intricate parts of balance.

I brainstormed for quite a while on Special Rules that would help the Spirit be interesting, but not overpowered. I settled on removing the 2nd and 3rd Special Rule and adding in a variant of the 3rd one. It would still do what I wanted, but to a more controllable/interactive level.

**You may pay X Energy to gain X Sun Elements**

That sounded a lot better to me and removing the original gathering Special Rule was an obvious choice anyway. This would still allow me to have larger counts of Sun Elements and would put the Energy I was gaining to good use.

Now I was able to move on to the next piece.

* **Part 3 - Innate Powers**
   * I analyzed the Innate Powers and decided to shift the Elemental thresholds around. I gave the devour Innate Power all the Earth Elements and the gathering Innate Power all of the Sun Elements.
   * I made the gathering Innate Power slow and placed a limit on it by forcing the player to pay Energy (a la the Special Rule) to be able to Gather Invaders.

So now they looked like this:

* The Ravenous Hunger Devours
   * Slow, Range 0, Any
   * Threshold #1: 1 Earth, 1 Sun
      * Deal 2 Damage.
   * Threshold #2: 3 Earth 1 Air, 3 Sun
      * Instead, deal 6 Damage.
   * Threshold #3: 5 Earth 2, Air, 5 Sun
      * Instead, deal 12 Damage.
   * Notes: For each Town or City destroyed by this effect, +1 Fear.
* Mirage Leads to Certain Demise
   * Fast, Range 0, Any
   * Threshold #1: 3 Sun, 1 Air
      * Gather 1 Explorer per Sun
   * Threshold #2: 6 Sun, 2 Air
      * Gather 1 Town per 2 Sun.
   * Threshold #3: 10 Sun, 4 Air
      * Gather all Explorers or Towns.
   * Threshold #4: 5 Air
      * You may repeat the Power.

With a new set of Innate Powers that seemed harder to reach, but just as rewarding for doing so (or so I thought), I moved on to the next part.

* **Part 4 - Unique Power Cards:**
   * Bottomless Pits of Quicksand -&gt; Blinding Sandstorms
      * 3 Cost, Fast, Range 1, Any land
      * Invaders skip all Actions in target land this turn.
      * Elements: Sun/Air/Earth
   * Scorch with Desert Heat
      * 2-&gt;1 Cost, Slow, Range 1, Any land
      * 1 Damage
      * \+1 Damage if target land is Sand
      * Elements: Sun/Fire/Air -&gt; Sun/Fire
   * Singing Dunes of Sand -&gt; Grit and Gravel Chip Away
      * 1 Cost, Slow, Range 1, Any land
      * 1 Damage to each Town/City.
      * Elements: Earth/Fire
   * Thrashing Walls of Sand -&gt; Smothering Wall of Sand
      * 2 Cost, Slow, Range 1, Any land
      * 1 Fear.
      * Push up to 3 Explorers/Towns/Dahan OR Destroy 1 Town.
      * Elements: Air/Fire/Earth/Sun

The Unique Power Cards changed the most since I wasn’t happy with how most of them played in the first play-test. Turns out I still had a lot to learn when it comes to crafting Unique Power Cards in general in terms of effects and balance. These would continue to change and fluctuate from this point all the way to the end of the balancing cycle.

* **Part 5 - Growth Options:**
   * Reclaim All, Gain a Power Card -&gt; Reclaim All, Gain 1 Energy, Gain Earth OR Sun
   * Add a Presence (Range 3), Gain a Power Card.
   * Add a Presence (Range 0), Gain 2 Energy.

Shifting Desert isn’t primarily an Earth Spirit, so I didn’t want the Reclaim to be terribly strong. But it has Earth as the secondary Element, so I wanted it to be slightly better than some Reclaim All combinations.

Parts 6 through 8 are for play-testing, so I’m not going to go into that any more in this article.

So now you’ve seen how a lot of things can be revealed when play-testing what you’ve created. These revelations can in turn change a lot of the design of your Spirit (especially when your fundamentals aren’t in place completely).

I recommend anyone who wants to make their own Spirit follow the advice given above. It makes the process more streamlined and helps to identify problems earlier in the design.

Next time will be the final article where I reveal what I consider to be the (nearly) finished Spirit and give tips for how to play-test efficiently in addition to a smattering of lessons that I learned that I think will be useful to everyone else who attempts something like this.",t2_nqwfg,False,,0,False,Spirit Island Home-brew - Pt. 4 - Back to the Drawing Board,[],r/boardgames,False,6,,0,,False,t3_c922pk,False,dark,#edeff1,public,48,0,{},,2fdfa772-9cf0-11e8-922c-0e3a76b3c6b0,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,48,,self,1562589539.0,,"[{'a': ':spirit_island:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/5dhccdeqncf11_t5_2qmjp/spirit_island'}, {'e': 'text', 't': ' Heart of the Wildfire'}]",{},,True,,1562272447.0,text,6,,richtext,self.boardgames,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c4mxeg/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_1_intro_and_initial/""&gt;Part 1 - Intro and Initial Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Gather when Presence is placed.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here’s where we run into some problems. It was obvious from the first play-test that this Special Rule was too powerful. The thematic fantasy of the Spirit was already being fulfilled by the second Innate Power, so I didn’t need to add it into the Special Rules as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert Plant and Water into Sun

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I liked the idea, but was a little strange in execution. It also meant that my Spirit could never help with certain Events that arose during play. That felt bad, so this needed to be changed as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as you can see, I was stopped on only step 2 of 8, revealing to me that I needed to work on the fundamentals once more before I moved on to the actual number-tweaking and other intricate parts of balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I brainstormed for quite a while on Special Rules that would help the Spirit be interesting, but not overpowered. I settled on removing the 2nd and 3rd Special Rule and adding in a variant of the 3rd one. It would still do what I wanted, but to a more controllable/interactive level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may pay X Energy to gain X Sun Elements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sounded a lot better to me and removing the original gathering Special Rule was an obvious choice anyway. This would still allow me to have larger counts of Sun Elements and would put the Energy I was gaining to good use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I was able to move on to the next piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 3 - Innate Powers&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I analyzed the Innate Powers and decided to shift the Elemental thresholds around. I gave the devour Innate Power all the Earth Elements and the gathering Innate Power all of the Sun Elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I made the gathering Innate Power slow and placed a limit on it by forcing the player to pay Energy (a la the Special Rule) to be able to Gather Invaders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now they looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Ravenous Hunger Devours

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slow, Range 0, Any&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threshold #1: 1 Earth, 1 Sun

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deal 2 Damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threshold #2: 3 Earth 1 Air, 3 Sun

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, deal 6 Damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threshold #3: 5 Earth 2, Air, 5 Sun

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, deal 12 Damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notes: For each Town or City destroyed by this effect, +1 Fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mirage Leads to Certain Demise

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast, Range 0, Any&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threshold #1: 3 Sun, 1 Air

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather 1 Explorer per Sun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threshold #2: 6 Sun, 2 Air

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather 1 Town per 2 Sun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threshold #3: 10 Sun, 4 Air

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather all Explorers or Towns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threshold #4: 5 Air

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may repeat the Power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a new set of Innate Powers that seemed harder to reach, but just as rewarding for doing so (or so I thought), I moved on to the next part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 4 - Unique Power Cards:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bottomless Pits of Quicksand -&amp;gt; Blinding Sandstorms

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 Cost, Fast, Range 1, Any land&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invaders skip all Actions in target land this turn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elements: Sun/Air/Earth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scorch with Desert Heat

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2-&amp;gt;1 Cost, Slow, Range 1, Any land&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Damage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+1 Damage if target land is Sand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elements: Sun/Fire/Air -&amp;gt; Sun/Fire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Singing Dunes of Sand -&amp;gt; Grit and Gravel Chip Away

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Cost, Slow, Range 1, Any land&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Damage to each Town/City.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elements: Earth/Fire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thrashing Walls of Sand -&amp;gt; Smothering Wall of Sand

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 Cost, Slow, Range 1, Any land&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Fear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push up to 3 Explorers/Towns/Dahan OR Destroy 1 Town.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elements: Air/Fire/Earth/Sun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Unique Power Cards changed the most since I wasn’t happy with how most of them played in the first play-test. Turns out I still had a lot to learn when it comes to crafting Unique Power Cards in general in terms of effects and balance. These would continue to change and fluctuate from this point all the way to the end of the balancing cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 5 - Growth Options:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reclaim All, Gain a Power Card -&amp;gt; Reclaim All, Gain 1 Energy, Gain Earth OR Sun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a Presence (Range 3), Gain a Power Card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a Presence (Range 0), Gain 2 Energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shifting Desert isn’t primarily an Earth Spirit, so I didn’t want the Reclaim to be terribly strong. But it has Earth as the secondary Element, so I wanted it to be slightly better than some Reclaim All combinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parts 6 through 8 are for play-testing, so I’m not going to go into that any more in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now you’ve seen how a lot of things can be revealed when play-testing what you’ve created. These revelations can in turn change a lot of the design of your Spirit (especially when your fundamentals aren’t in place completely).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend anyone who wants to make their own Spirit follow the advice given above. It makes the process more streamlined and helps to identify problems earlier in the design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time will be the final article where I reveal what I consider to be the (nearly) finished Spirit and give tips for how to play-test efficiently in addition to a smattering of lessons that I learned that I think will be useful to everyone else who attempts something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

466,,boardgames,"Hi everyone

Last time we played a match of GoT, we decided to do a 7 player match without the Targaryen house and board to see how including the Arryn would change the original game dynamics.

As far as I remember, the manual doesn't explicitly say that you can't play as Arryn without Targaryen (it specifically says to always put the Eyrie extensor over the original game - the Essos board is only included if someone picked Targ) and I've searched on BGG/similar forums - it was universally accepted that wasn't an issue.

However, the only thing that bothered us was their initial unit setup. They get three knights and a boat from the get go? Is that right? We've looked through the MoD manual and it doesn't say anything about their setup without Essos.

We thought they felt somewhat overpowered due to that (and the Eyrie being a 4 point-strong garrison) so that even a moderately skilled player could steamroll Baratheon (and to a lesser extent Stark) quite easily.

Is there something we aren't getting or that's just the way it is? Does having Arryn in a 7 player game changes initial unit setup for other houses? Are there any official/unnoficial rules talking about this?

The game was going nicely, we were having fun, until one of them has noticed that every time a card was passed to me, I was taking a look at my own hand of cards, trying to figure out what are chances that the person giving me the card is lying about what's on it.

After noticing this, she has immediately accused me of cheating and both of them quit the game and told me to never bring it again.

Obviously this wasn't the case, and they were basically playing blind, only relying on their social skills to call the bluffs.

She has argued that the game is about calling bluffs and it goes against the spirit of the game to statistically determine which cards are still in play. Which makes some sense but at the same time it can't possibly be cheating to look at your own hand, can it?

The rules doesn't say it explicitly, but it seems so ridiculous to me. Still, it left a sour taste in my mouth and I'm not sure if I want to play the game again.

475,,boardgames,"This post assumes you know the rules to the game called The Great Dalmuti.  I am sure there are rules descriptions of it on YouTube if you need a refresher

This variant gives the Greater/Lesser Peons more power and makes it more fun to be on the bottom,

How to play this variant:
In the beginning of the game, Before Taxation,  The Greater and Lesser Peons conspire against the Great Dalmuti by picking one Jester to be the Jester of Death.  The other a Jester is called the Jester of Good Fortune.  

This is done with everyone’s eyes closed except the Peons at the beginning of a round.

After the Jester of Death has been decided play a round as normal.


The Jester card plays the same just like in the normal game of Dalmuti,  it’s rank 13 or you can play it as an additional card just like normal.

If the Jester gets played with any card 4 or lower, it has entered the castle.

Jesters that have entered the castle, at the very end of the of the round activate.  

If the Jester of Death activates at the end of the round, something bad happens to the Great Dalmuti.  Here is what I was thinking.


1. Disgrace the Greater Dalmuti ( they can never ever be Dalmuti again)
2. Killing the Greater Dalmuti ( The Greater dalmuti is eliminated from the game)


If the Jester of Good fortune activates, something good happens to the dalmuti, Here is what I was thinking.

1.The Greater Dalmuti ascends to the position of the Greatest Dalmuti. Which means there are 3 positions of royalty now,  Lesser dalmuti,  Great dalmuti and the Greatest Dalmuti.  (The highest merchant becomes the lesser dalmuti. Everyone else moves up, except merchants and peons)



This makes it more fun to be a Peon and adds a guessing game to the Dalmuti gameplay with additional mind games.


Now if you made it this far thank you for reading.  

I came up with a way for the royalty to shoo a Jester away before the Jesters activate.

The three cards in the game are called the Earl Marshall’s.  But in this variant,  One of them is Called the Supreme Earl Marshall and this card can get rid of a Jester that has entered the castle.


I’m not sure exactly when it gets rid of a Jester that has entered the castle.

Maybe after it is played?

Or who ever has played the Supreme Earl Marshall, can decided whether to shoo a Jester away at the end of the Game.

What do you think or recommend?

Final question.

I’m curious to hear your thoughts,  if both Jesters are in the castle at the end of the round, what happens?

Does the Dalmuti pick one (hoping he picks the Good Fortune Jester)

Or do both Jesters cancel each other out.

Out of curiosity, I copied my BGG collection into an excel file and listed my expenses in this hobby since I’ve started. Most of my receipts are available either in my email, on amazon, or on target. There were only a handful that I had to guess prices for.

I’ve been collecting for about 4-5 years now. My BGG collection sits at 110, including expansions. Minus expansions i have 67 games. 

I estimated I spent about $3400 on games, and about another $100 on a folding table and kallax shelves. 

This doesn’t include two kickstarters I’ve currently backed and am awaiting.

The bulk of my expenses come from backing a couple of expensive all-in kickstarters (Xia, Dinosaur Island, Aeons End, Batman Gotham City Chronicles, 7th continent).. and of course KDM and it’s wave 1 expansions also added up, but I was able to back these before they were full price.

Barring these, the rest of my collection ($1300) were usually purchased when games were marked as “all time lows” on ccc, clearance sales, B2G1 deals, and a couple of B&amp;N $2 clearance deals. I think the only game I paid full price for (nonkickstarter) was Catan and some of its expansions.. my first introduction into tabletop games. 

That being said, if you had to estimate- how much have you dropped on your collection? Do you feel as if the entertainment had was worth the cost?

If I had to guess, I’ve probably had 50 game nights over the past 5 years.. so $70/night? Never mind that i have about 15 unplayed games, 20+ unplayed expansions, and several games played once! Nevertheless, you could do a lot worse for a night out.

Edit: looks like we got a huge bell curve of numbers here! 

Here’s a tool that will estimate your BGG value (based on market prices, and doesn’t take into consideration Kickstarter versions and exclusives.) It doesn’t equal what you actually paid tho.. I paid less than my collection is worth.

485,,boardgames,"Hi there,

hope you guys could help me out a bit. 

I'm currently looking for a dungeon crawler for my group and myself (Solo or two player). We played The Dark Eye pretty often, but now I would like to try some new things out. During my search I stumbled upon Gloomhaven and Middara. I had the chance to playtest a short round of Gloomhaven at Spiel in Essen and it was quite cool.

But I am uncertain if Gloomhaven would fit to us. 

This week I looked at Middara KS and it seems to inclued more rolleplaying elements regarding customization and individuality. The artwork was pretty amazing and the miniatures are cool.

So are there any people who have played both and can answear some questions I have?

1: Replayabity? I know that you use stamps or stickers in GH to mark special points on the map, does it make it less fun to play it again? In Middara you have different endings depending on your choices and the Skills you can take, make a different character.

2: Complexity? Due to the amount of individual character builds, are the rules in Middara more complex and harder to learn than in GH? Some of our players have a short memory and I hate to explain rules over and over again. 

3: Story? Is the Story in Middara influenced by the manga style? Is it more ""adult"" like Berserk or something like that? It looks pretty ""childish"" from the artwork sometimes. How is the story of GH compared to that?

4: Solo or Two player? I know that you can play both games alone, but how much fun is that? I read that GH can be pretty complex when playing alone. Sometimes I like to play a boardgame by myself, if the rules don't need a gamemaster. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sry for the long post, but now that the Middara KS is online it would be cool to decide between those two games.

491,,boardgames,"Hi r/boardgames :) 

Just wondering how you guys deal with playing a game for the first time / few times and it didn’t live up to your expectations? Do you give it another chance or move on? 

I’m asking this to decide whether or not to sell off my copy of Concordia. I plan to keep my collection lean (15 games or so) so usually I’m okay with selling off games which I didn’t really enjoy. However Concordia was one of the games I’d always thought I’d love so selling it off feels like a possible mistake. 

I’m not entirely sure what it is about Concordia that I didn’t like as well, as usually good mechanics are what draws me to the game and I think Concordia has excellent mechanics. I suspect that there isn’t enough of a tactical element to Concordia. For example I love how you have to figure out how to allocate/use your dice for this round in Troyes/Marco Polo or respond to what meeples your oppenents put down and what tiles come up in Keyflower.

494,,boardgames,"Hi guys, had very fond memories playing this game in board game cafes with a group of close friends many years back, and I've been trying to hunt it down recently.

What I recall is that there are a mess of cards on the table, and the objective of the game is to complete a full set of cards of one type (I vaguely recall it may be dinosaur themed, but I might be wrong) either through putting down x cards and picking up x cards, or trading x cards with someone else (again can't remember if it's either mechanic or both).

The crucial part of the game though, is there are a number of rubber bones on the table, totaling one less than the number of players playing, i.e. if there are 7 players playing there will be 6 bones. Once someone has completed a set of cards, he/she will then discreetly take a bone from the table. For everyone else, once they notice one of the bones is missing, they have to immediately snatch up a bone too, until there are no more bones at the table (at which point the person who didn't grab a bone is the loser).

This was always hilarious fun as we would pretend to keep searching for cards even after all the bones were gone, and there was invariably one person who would keep frantically trying to complete their set long after all the bones had been collected.

496,,boardgames,"Little context. We've played a couple games that we're one versus many, and most of the time I seem to be the solo player, which I don't mind at all, but sometimes you need to sacrifice a bit of your enjoyment to make it fun for the other players. In our collection we have Imperial assault, Betrayal, Spectre Ops, and recently acquired fury of dracula, that all fall into this category. 

This week we played Fury of Dracula, which was new to everyone but a couple of us. Our dracula player was on fire. He got 2 weeks in before the hunters even stumbled upon his path (we had bad luck with event draws). The other players at the table HATED the game. The last few rounds were excruciating to get through as they were bitter and resented having to keep playing. So I felt bad as we seemingly wasted a lot of time playing, and me having bought the game, wasted money on something nobody would want to play again.

502,,boardgames,"I hosted a game the other day where someone mentioned they privately told someone their role.(told, not showed) They were the minion working for the werewolves.

This brought up the debate over if this type of chatter is allowed. I'd love to hear what everyone thinks. Here are my thoughts:

* In this example, the player was telling the truth. But this could have been a lie.

* They did not show their actual role card to the player. That would 100% be against the rules.

* This was a 9-player game, so it was relatively intimate. They slipped in the information during the chaos.

I feel like there is a good argument for and against this. Partly, I don't like encouraging side conversations. This takes away from the heart of the game. At the same time, the game is meant to be about manipulation and lying. Nothing is stopping a player from saying something that is a lie publicly.

I also feel like the size of the game warrants another opinion. In games of 40+ that I've been a part of, it's going to be impossible to maintain order and only hear a single player talk at once. Side conversations are much more likely at that point. It's very difficult to coordinate with all players at those larger numbers. In these cases, I think it would be more acceptable. Again, what you say may be a lie.

Would like to hear some thoughts, but I am leaning towards allowing this in future games.

**Description from Boardgamegeek**:

Description from the publisher:

The T.I.M.E Agency protects humanity by preventing temporal faults and paradoxes from threatening the fabric of our universe. As temporal agents, you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.

T.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of ""decksploration"". Each player is free to give their character as deep a ""role"" as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it's also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.

At the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the number of players. Each attempt is called a ""run""; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players' disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario’s obstacles.

The base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which — Asylum — is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers.

You usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you'll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time...

In the box, an insert allows players to ""save"" the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game. This way, it's possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles, the remaining TU, the discovered clues, etc.

T.I.M.E Stories is a decksploring game in which each deck makes anything possible!

It uses cubes as building materials for a pyramid. Each cube has an icon and color, and is placed atop a cradle which allows you to construct a pyramid. Each turn players can pull one cube from the pyramid as long as at least 2 faces are exposed, and it's not directly touching a cobra cube. Each cube is worth 1, 2, or 3 points, but the 1 point cubes help you achieve majority for each color, which can give you bonus points at the end of the game.

509,,boardgames,"Hi All,

  I ordered a table of ultimate gaming 4.6 elite (with a few accessories) in May and was told July delivery. 

  June 28th i came home from work and saw a big box at the end of my driveway.  I looked and noticed it was part of my table... very confused as many others have experienced, i had no notification of the table coming.  There was also a long box at the garage...

  After breaking my back carrying in the 80lb box, I noticed it said 2 of 2.  I emailed TOUG and so far no response as to whether or not i will get tracking numbers and how many boxes my ordered shipment will come in. 

  Since then i have received 2 more boxes on Monday and Tuesday. 

    I ordered:
       The 4.6 Elite Table
       Table Tops
       Table Mat (Black)
       PVC cover
       2x 2-Cup Holders (Free with code!)

   i ask those of who have received part or all of your table: How many boxes did the shipment come in? I have already received (as i said) box 2 of 2 for the table, the mat, the PVC cover and the table tops.  I am assuming there are 2 or 3 more boxes coming. Box 1 of 2 and either one or two boxes with the cup holders.

   I found the instructions and other people's posts that say 4 boxes... but i am wondering since i got the 2nd version, maybe they streamlined the packaging of the table proper into 2 boxes?

  Is the table in 2 boxes or 4? 

Thanks

Let’s be honest – there is too much happening in board games. There are too many games, too many podcasts, too many blogs. Just too much of everything!

This is a [modified repost](https://meeplelikeus.co.uk/meeple-monthly-roundup-july-2018/) (with mod permission) of an article that was originally posted on Meeple Like Us and it's aimed at raising the profile of all the great stuff out there you might have missed last year. I'm hoping to do one of these at the start(ish) of each month in 2019.  This post is from 2018.  It's a historical digest - an attempt to make sure great things don't fall into the memory hole.

There's also a [round up for the previous month](http://meeplelikeus.co.uk/meeple-monthly-roundup-june-2018/) if you want to catch up with what (was) great in tabletop coverage!  As in, what was great in 2018, which is last year.

I’m regularly blown away by how much work people put into their own reskinned version of their favourite games.  [This remake of Ethnos to fit the Moana theme though](https://imgur.com/a/hNItFN5)… not only is it a marvelous piece of work it is a very fitting tribute for an absolutely joyful theme.   I see what’s happening, yeah. We’re face to face with greatness and it’s strange.

* * *

Have you been keeping track of the Overturn Kickstarter drama?  If not, then [this writeup from the Australian Tabletop Gaming Network](http://atgn.com.au/overturn-rising-sands-kickstarter-caught-plagiarising-still-track-funded/) will get you all up to speed.  As long as the speed and aggression with which KS projects get funded remains a point of pride within this hobby, things like this are going to keep happening.   You’ll also get a lot of hot takes on the [Reddit thread on the controversy](http://atgn.com.au/overturn-rising-sands-kickstarter-caught-plagiarising-still-track-funded/).  Kickstarter eventually responded by suspending the project, and as you might imagine that provoked [its own thread of spirited discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8zxe1l/overturn_kickstarter_suspended/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=boardgames).

* * *

Given some of the things that we’ve discussed in the past with regards to paid previews/reviews of games it won’t come as any surprise that we were interested in [this reddit thread on the value of paid previews](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8whr11/heres_a_list_of_the_top_5_games_according_to/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=browse&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=boardgames).  The key question here is ‘value for whom?’  

A similar thread popped up on BGG and I’ll also [direct your attention that way](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2032372/sad-state-kickstarter-reviews-and-previews).

* * *

Conventions can be a tense time for people - they’re loud, busy and often stressful.  Many people love them and are energised by them. Some though find them intimidating and uncomfortable.   We’ve been through a rough patch regarding conventions but we have this [upbeat tale of a mother and her daughter visiting Dice Tower Con](http://www.meeplemountain.com/articles/a-mother-and-daughter-walk-into-dice-tower-con/) as a more hopeful take.

* * *

Teaching the rules of a game is one of the more constant challenges that face many of us that are enthusiasts for the hobby.   Before anyone gets to have fun they have to listen to a lecture like they walked into some kind of weird board-game classroom.  [Pawn and Pint put up an interesting video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb-CNylD90w&amp;feature=youtu.be) about how they approach the task and why they do it.  

* * *

There are lots of studies that show gaming has a positive impact on depression and other conditions.  Play Therapy is a real thing and has been a topic of vibrant study for years. I found [this reddit post on boardgaming and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8wzpic/boardgaming_is_helping_me_fight_depression/) to be a heartening read as a personal testimony.

* * *

Last month we pointed you to the work of Ertay over at the Sightless Fun blog as he worked to make Pandemic accessible.  Well, he’s [done it again with Secret Hitler](https://sightless.fun/Secret-Hitler-Board-Games-You-Can-Play-Blind/) and (obviously) I think you should head over there and check out what he’s been doing.

* * *

Being a cloistered academic with no real world skills, I’m often profoundly envious of people that actually make things.  I look at their hobby projects like a dog that’s been fooled by a fake thrown ball one too many times - some kind of trick must be involved, right?  But no, here’s an [awesome video of a game table](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WbmgpryC5k&amp;feature=youtu.be) being made right in front of you.  

* * *

It seems like Kickstarter games are engaged in a constant spiral of oneupsmanship, each trying to outdo each other in terms of the ridiculously lavish and over the top production values they offer backers.   That’s fine and all, although I’m increasingly concerned about the socioeconomic impact such indulgence has on the hobby. I think we can all agree though, I hope, [when your ‘miniatures’ are bigger than an actual baby](https://twitter.com/eric_lang/status/1015389267701436416) it’s time to take a moment and step back even if it’s just to change the language.  

* * *

One of my favourite discussions this week was on a Reddit thread that managed to end up with 146 comments and zero upvotes.   It was on the [Splotter series of games and how the author believes the finished products look like prototypes](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8wyo43/can_we_all_agree_that_splotters_despite_having/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=boardgames).  There’s a lot in here to consider including the views of those that like the graphic design, those that don’t, and those that take the topic off the rails into more philosophical areas of value, elitism and game design.  

* * *

Have you at any point found yourself thinking ‘I wish I knew what BoardGameGeek’s community had collaboratively decided were the best games of each chronological year from 1968 onwards?’.   Admit it, you have - we all have. Well, you can have it Cinders! [Here’s a Reddit post that gives you that exact thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8whr11/heres_a_list_of_the_top_5_games_according_to/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=browse&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=boardgames).   

* * *

Kevin Wilson appears relatively frequently in these roundups because his twitter threads are usually very good.  Here’s [another one on design bandwagons](https://twitter.com/KevinWilson42) and it’s well worth your attention if you’re at all interested in game design.

* * *

Another great Twitter thread is [this one from Actualol](https://twitter.com/actualol/status/1023709555769987072) on how Twitter itself makes him depressed and distressed on a daily basis.  There is so much of value in here. A lot of Twitter follows a cycle of ‘virtue [gazumping](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/gazump?s=t)’ that ends with everyone feeling sad, helpless and endlessly judged.   I think a lot of people on Twitter are well meaning, but also stuck in a dangerously naive echo chamber where mass agreement is easily mistaken for having a positive impact.  Anyway, that’s me editorialising but I think you should definitely check out and reflect upon what Actualol has to say.

* * *

Being aware of people with disabilities at a convention is hugely important - it’s already busy, crowded and stressful and carelessness can be a major impediment to people enjoying the experience.  [Hans Cummings has a great post up](https://vffpublishing.com/2018/07/19/take-care-be-aware-at-gen-con/), specifically about Gencon but applicable to any convention, that’s well worth reading to make sure you’re appreciative of the challenges people might be facing.

* * *

A new documentary about board game designers has been announced, coming from a partnership between [Zoom Out Media and BoardgGameGeek](http://thegamedesignersmovie.com).  The problem is, [as Katie Chironis points out](https://twitter.com/kchironis/status/1022191549658976256), that of the 28 designers they were originally featuring, not one was a woman.  It’s genuinely is a really poor showing in this day and age. When asked on Twitter about who should have been included, Katie also provided a link [to this excellent Reddit](https://t.co/nSAz8SCLWf) post that lists women designers and their associated BGG ranking.   At the time of writing, some women designers have been added to the lineup but it’s really not good enough that it takes a public backlash for a half-hearted stab at representation.

* * *

I have never played Tales from the Loop (RPGs are a difficult thing to fit around all the other obligations and barriers in my life) but I have been enchanted by its art, design and aesthetic.  So I’m really interested to see that Amazon are going to be making a [Tales from the Loop television series](https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/amazon-tales-from-the-loop-1202875431/). It’s kind of weird though - Tales from the Loop is kind of like ‘Stranger Things: The Game’ and now ‘Stranger Things: The Game’ is going to become ‘Stranger Things: The Game: The TV Show’.   I’ll be keen to see how it all manifests.

* * *

Rebecca Strang of [To Play is Human](https://toplayishuman.com) and Lauren Woolsey of the [CGS Unit](https://cgsunit.com) have teamed up to start a new podcast focused on inclusion and accessibility - it’s called the [Playability podcast](https://playability.fireside.fm/0) and you can [follow their Facebook page here](https://www.facebook.com/PlayabilityPod/)!   I couldn’t be happier to see more voices covering this important topic and we here at MLU wish them all the luck in the world.  We’ll be following along closely!

* * *

I saw a really interesting thread on Twitter - it’s from [Papa Shell](https://twitter.com/Papa_Shell) and it’s about the [real-life economics of TTRPG publishing](https://twitter.com/Papa_Shell/status/1021902196080893952).  It’s an enlightening read regarding just how little money there is in even what seems like a monster hit.  

* * *

As always, one from the archives to finish up.  I was reading through some old [Cardboard Children](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/09/27/cardboard-children-goodbye/) columns the other day, because that’s just the kind of guy I am.   I made it all the way through to the earliest entry and thought ‘Well, that’s a good thing to put into the roundup for this month’. For those that don’t know, this was Robert Florence’s (mostly) weekly article for Rock Paper Shotgun on the topic of board-games.  I’ve made no secret in the past that I think Rab Florence is great, and I believe he’s one of the most undervalued talents in the hobby. He’s been at it a long time too, as this [column from September of 2010 shows](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2010/09/18/cardboard-children-dungeonquest/).   In **completely unrelated** news, you should all also keep checking out [Cast the Bones](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5wtuY_UIcHG6LguU5mlT4g) for the absolute best thing that is happening in board game video content.  Happening right now! I am going to keep plugging this thing until it gets the attention it deserves.  

# This Month’s Spotlight

**This is happening this year again too on the 24th and 25th of August, 2019!  Come along!  Say hi!  I'll be there, but that's no reason to give it a miss!**

Are you in Scotland, or at least within easy reach of the [Scottish city of Perth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth,_Scotland)?   If so, you really should come along to [Tabletop Scotland](http://tabletopscotland.co.uk), a new Scottish gaming convention that will be running on the 1st and 2nd of September.    It’s shaping up to be a marvelous event, including lots of open gaming space, roleplaying game sessions, local and national game tournaments and a whole lot more.  We’ll be there too, [running a seminar](http://tabletopscotland.co.uk/events/accessibility-in-gaming/) on game accessibility.   I did have plans before to kick off something like this myself but I’m delighted, given how little I enjoy organizing anything, to see that someone else has taken the initiative and done considerably better than I ever could.   If you’re around, or can make the trip, consider coming along!",t2_5c0kk,False,,0,False,"What you might have missed last year in July, 2018",[],r/boardgames,False,6,,0,,False,t3_c8ly0g,False,dark,,public,34,0,{},,3a7b96c6-18aa-11e7-88c2-0e0bfb1a8e84,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,34,,self,False,chinatown,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Meeple Like Us'}]",{},,True,,1562174520.0,text,6,,richtext,self.boardgames,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw a really interesting thread on Twitter - it’s from &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/Papa_Shell""&gt;Papa Shell&lt;/a&gt; and it’s about the &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/Papa_Shell/status/1021902196080893952""&gt;real-life economics of TTRPG publishing&lt;/a&gt;.  It’s an enlightening read regarding just how little money there is in even what seems like a monster hit.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, one from the archives to finish up.  I was reading through some old &lt;a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/09/27/cardboard-children-goodbye/""&gt;Cardboard Children&lt;/a&gt; columns the other day, because that’s just the kind of guy I am.   I made it all the way through to the earliest entry and thought ‘Well, that’s a good thing to put into the roundup for this month’. For those that don’t know, this was Robert Florence’s (mostly) weekly article for Rock Paper Shotgun on the topic of board-games.  I’ve made no secret in the past that I think Rab Florence is great, and I believe he’s one of the most undervalued talents in the hobby. He’s been at it a long time too, as this &lt;a href=""https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2010/09/18/cardboard-children-dungeonquest/""&gt;column from September of 2010 shows&lt;/a&gt;.   In &lt;strong&gt;completely unrelated&lt;/strong&gt; news, you should all also keep checking out &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5wtuY_UIcHG6LguU5mlT4g""&gt;Cast the Bones&lt;/a&gt; for the absolute best thing that is happening in board game video content.  Happening right now! I am going to keep plugging this thing until it gets the attention it deserves.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;This Month’s Spotlight&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is happening this year again too on the 24th and 25th of August, 2019!  Come along!  Say hi!  I&amp;#39;ll be there, but that&amp;#39;s no reason to give it a miss!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you in Scotland, or at least within easy reach of the &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth,_Scotland""&gt;Scottish city of Perth&lt;/a&gt;?   If so, you really should come along to &lt;a href=""http://tabletopscotland.co.uk""&gt;Tabletop Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, a new Scottish gaming convention that will be running on the 1st and 2nd of September.    It’s shaping up to be a marvelous event, including lots of open gaming space, roleplaying game sessions, local and national game tournaments and a whole lot more.  We’ll be there too, &lt;a href=""http://tabletopscotland.co.uk/events/accessibility-in-gaming/""&gt;running a seminar&lt;/a&gt; on game accessibility.   I did have plans before to kick off something like this myself but I’m delighted, given how little I enjoy organizing anything, to see that someone else has taken the initiative and done considerably better than I ever could.   If you’re around, or can make the trip, consider coming along!&lt;/p&gt;

524,,boardgames,"I had a discussion the other day, inspired by a coop game (Gen7) and I'd like to see what people think about it.

The discussion came from the game being increasingly complicated, and from situations arising where we needed to exactly plan out a round in detail before even taking the first action. A few times during this and previous sessions, I felt that the situation can get a bit too complicated, and in those cases we should put a threshold on how much we discuss, and accept that there may be less than optimal plays. Another player thought that we should dedicate a few more minutes to analyze the situation and reach a conclusion instead.

During the discussions, we focused on the following aspects of the issue. 

* I felt that some players, including me, get tired from the cognitive load of presenting and analyzing all options some times (especially when we discuss for a few minutes and then we realize that we forgot a parameter and the discussion needs to restart, etc.). The other player said that that's fine, in that case the players who are tired can step back and let the rest, who still enjoy it, figure out the situation and let them know what to do.
* I pointed out that being told what to do is taking away the joy of the game to an extent, since at that point it stops being a cooperative experience. It's the alpha player problem. The other player said that being forced to stop figuring out the optimal solution is also taking away the joy of the game, the whole point is to gather and figure out the solutions to the situations presented, together (those who want and can do it at each point). They also thought that another player who was in this situation was probably happy to step back and let the rest figure it out. 
* Note that during most of the game we all participate in the discussion and problem solving, it's only a few times when we reach the point where I think we're past the threshold, so take the sentences in the previous point to be about occasional times during play, and not the entirety of it.
* The other player also said that if the majority of the people around the table feel like I do, and don't want to step back, then the other player would agree to stop analyzing and get on with the game, but they feel it's not that much of a problem for anyone who gets tired to step back for a few minutes, since otherwise their own reason to play gets taken away involuntarily.

To me it seems that the above ways to look at this situation are at odds and can't be fully reconciled. Of course, depending on how pronounced they are in the game, they can be overcome by small compromise, perhaps.

530,,boardgames,"Ever since Yahtzee, and probably ever since dice existed and people could start drawing lines in the sand, roll-and-write games have been popular. Despite its popularity, Yahtzee often gets dismissed quite quickly by gamers looking for more decisions. Enter Qwixx, a dice game from 2012, which brought all players into the game - even when it wasn't your turn. It won a lot of awards, and helped bring back the roll-and-write game into the spotlight. But Qwixx was still a very light game, and that's where **That's Pretty Clever** (2018) comes in. Originally called **Ganz schön clever**, this game is clever. But it's also addictive, fast, and fun. And perhaps most importantly for gamers: it has depth.

**Game-play**

The game-play seems familiar at first - you're rolling dice, keeping some, and re-rolling. But what makes That's Pretty Clever especially interesting is that you'll enter the dice you roll into coloured areas, trying to set yourself up to score chains of points later in the game. And you need to think about the fact that any dice you don't use yourself have the potential to be used by other players. It's ever so addictive, and once you grok the game-play, you'll find yourself playing it over and over, in your quest to get the highest score. In fact, you'll like it that much, that you'll probably even play it on your own.

**Impressions**

That's Pretty Clever is an outstanding roll-and-write game, and deserves all the praise it has received. It won't be for everyone, because it's not the light and carefree filler that it first appears to be. So if you're expecting a simple Yahtzee style game, you'll be in for somewhat of a surprise. But this is exactly why it was nominated for the Kennerspiel des Jahres, and not the more family-friendly Spiel des Jahres award. The fun in this game lies in the combos, and you'll need to plan ahead to try to set these up, which involves some real crunchiness. There's still some luck, since it's a dice game after all, and this will at times frustrate you. But the game is engaging enough - especially once you start hitting some combos - to keep you come back to it, over and over!

Despite the absence of theme, the real appeal here is how it creates the feel of being an engine builder, while remaining a relatively simple dice game. You're doing much more than just pushing your luck, like in most roll-and-write dice games. Instead you're drafting dice in a way that is ... well ... clever! This may make it a little more meaty than what the average family or non-gamer is prepared to handle, but gamers will lap it up. Expect some tough decision making, which will prove especially rewarding as you start triggering chains of points. I wouldn't suggest playing with more than 3 players, due to the risk of down-time, but for 2-3 players it's just perfect. The solo option and app are fantastic as well.

**Recommendation**

Has the roll-and-write finally grown up? Unsurprisingly, That's Pretty Clever has been a huge hit ever since it came out in 2018, and has been nominated for some big awards, including the 2018 Kennerspiel des Jahre. It also went on to win the Golden Geek for 2018 Best Solo Board Game. And its continued success is guaranteed with a new edition now available from American publisher Stronghold Games.

Just when you thought that the roll-and-write category had exhausted its potential, something new like That's Pretty Clever (2018) shows up to surprise us. Along with its sequel Twice As Clever (2019), these are very welcome additions to the ranks of roll-and-move games, especially for gamers.

536,,boardgames,"Hi, I'm back with another bunch of mini reviews, or opinions, of new games (to me) that I've played during the second quarter of 2019.  
Here's my post for Q1: https://old.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/b82p2a/ive_played_20_new_to_me_games_so_far_this_year/  
  
I've not been playing as much as I usually do, mostly because there's been other things to take care of, and I was also ill for almost 2 weeks. So I've only got perhaps a third of what I usually play during 3 months. So that's why I have limited plays of these new games.  
Like last time, it's only my opinions, not actually educated reviews :)  
    
**Castles of Caladale** (2017), (3 plays, 2x2p 1x3p)  
I saw a Rahdo run through of this some time ago that got me interested, and recently found it at my FLGS at half price so I picked it up. It was an ok filler, fast and at first nice that it was not very strict how you placed your tiles. But I played it 3 times in April and haven't thought about it once since then, and now the lack of strictness is what is making me not want to play it again. One of my friends really liked it though, so might keep it anyway. 4/10.  
  
**Wreck Raiders** (2019) (2 plays, 2x2p)  
I Kickstarted this so I'm biased, but I loved this. There were some great decisions to be made, choosing the dice, placing your diver, and what to collect. I've only played it twice, I've had it difficult to get people to play it, some say the theme doesn't speak to them and that it sounds like a children's game. It might be aimed at families, but it's really great. I would like to play it with more players, as you keep helping your opponent too much on your own turns with 2 players (the worker next to where you place your worker also gets a treasure). Need to play more, but it's at 8.5/10 right now.  
  
**Jaipur** (2009), (2 plays, 2x2p)  
I mostly got this to play with my gf, we needed a new fast 2 player game after I destroyed Star Realms for us by playing it on the app and became much better than her. While Jaipur is a great game, it's not a replacement for those times we used to play Star Realms, it doesn't do it for us. We tried it twice at least, and I can see what people like about it. We'll see if we play it again. 6/10.  
  
**The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-earth** (2019) (2 plays, 1x2p, 1x5p)  
I'm a big Mansions of Madness 2e fan, and when I heard that they would make a LotR game in the same fashion, I was super excited. Then came many of the reviews, and from what I saw, it was a mediocre game. Well, they were wrong! This fits perfect for me, my gf, and my gaming group, and I think this is a game that thrive on the right group to play with. The card mechanism instead of rolling dice is excellent, the app is great, the tiles are beautiful, and the minis are really nice. Can't say that it really feels like a LotR game though, it could be any fantasy world, and they probably should have gone for that, but hey, they made me buy it ;) And Fantasy Flight has finally learned to number their damn map tiles! In MoM2e it's always a pain in the ass to find ""Street corner 2"" which there's several of. So I've only played this twice, but we'll play it a lot during the coming months and I think it will grow on me more. It's not gonna replace MoM2e for me though, but it's nice with a different theme and shorter play time. 8/10.  
  
**The Palace of Mad King Ludwig** (1 play, 1x2p)  
I hoped to get to play this again before I wrote this but I wasn't able to, so my opinions of this game is limited. Castles of Mad King Ludwig is one of my favorite games, so I wanted this in my collection myself, but my friend bought it so I tried his copy instead. And I must say, this was really strange to play, it felt like a mix of CoMKL and Surburbia, but somehow they manage to make it... underwhelming. I was thinking all the time ""oh it's like Suburbia here, wow! Oh it's like CoMKL there, wow!"", and when the game finished I wasn't at all excited about it. They tried to do so much but perhaps did too much. The tile placement was a little bit interesting, but then the tiles were really busy and hard to see, and some of the colors and icons didn't match. It was a mess. I still want to play it again but with more players. But right now, 5/10.  
  
**Copenhagen** (2019), (2 plays, 1x2p, 1x3p)  
I live close to Copenhagen so this caught my attention, and I do like placing polyominoes, Patchwork is another favorite. And it felt a little bit like Patchwork (or similar) mixed with Ticket to Ride, but the special powers are what made this game different, and much better. I liked it, it was easy, fast and fun. The table presence was excellent too, and having the first to 12 points being the winner made the pace of the game really satisfying. I think I will play this a lot more during the year. 7/10.  
  
**Minecraft** (2019) (1 play, 1x3p)  
Tried the prototype of the upcoming Minecraft game. I'm not allowed to say anything about it, sorry. But I liked it more than I thought I would.  
  
**Herbaceous Sprouts** (2019) (1 play, 1x3p)  
I bought this because I thought the theme was really nice and Steve Finn always gets my attention, he does some really nice and cosy games. I liked my one play of this, it's a quite short game and each turn is fast so not much waiting. You still have interesting choices to make each turn and I can see me playing this more. For now, 6 or 7/10.  
  
**Let's Make a Bus Route** (2018) (1 play, 1x4p)  
Only played this once, but I'm almost ready to give it a 10. I dreamt about this when I went to bed, seriously. This is a draw and write game where you make a bus route in Kyoto, each turn you draw a card which tells you what you need to draw on the map, and the card means different for each player, and you write on the same map. It's really great! One player managed to draw himself into a corner, which means you're eliminated from the game, and that sucked, I hate excluding people. But I guess you have to pay attention, and it really isn't that long game anyway. For now, 9/10.  
  
**Ticket to Ride: Switzerland** (2007), (1 play, 1x2p)  
Another game I've only played once. Ok, so not technically a new game, but I log them separately in BGstats so I count it as new. Switzerland was a good map, I like these small maps for lower player count. The Nordic map is my favorite, and this was almost as good, it was interesting that the locomotive cards could only be used for tunnels, even if it was annoying at some points :) If I were to put a number on this, I would want to rate it within the world of TTR, and then I place it third. Nordic first, then Europe, the Switzerland. And then I'll give it a 7/10.  
  
That's it for the second quarter. Hope to get more games played during the summer.  
Here's some short updates on the games I played during Q1.  
**Just One**, played another 4 times and I like it even more. It's now 8/10 for me. Really the only party game I've liked this much.  
**Quacks of Quedlingburg**, another 2 plays, still think it's great, but my friend bought his own copy, so I don't get to play it as much as I'd like, but very proud to introduce him to a game he bought himself :) Still 8/10.  
**Space Base**, the game I've perhaps played the most since last post with 6 more plays. Love this game though I never win, it's so pleasing to almost always get something, even if it's not your turn. Finally got my gf to play it and she absolutely hated it, too much luck, so yeah I guess I won't play it as much as I hoped :P It's 8/10 for me now though.",t2_3q0hb,False,,0,False,I played another 10 new games (to me) during Q2.

From the campaign page:

**""To the Barricades (not shown)**

**You will be able to order To the Barricades in the Pledge Manager as an Add-on. It will be priced at $50 + Shipping &amp; Handling (approximately $15 for US backers). It will be identical to the previous Kickstarter Reward and will have all stretch goals in that Reward. We won't be able to ship them Expedited unless they're included in an Expedited Reward.""**

From the FAQ

**""Can I order To The Barricades?**

**Yes! If you already have the base game (Retail, Adventurer or Champion) and you missed To the Barricades! you'll be able to order it in the Pledge Manager. It will be $50 + Shipping &amp; Handling.""**

I had some reservations about backing the campaign based on the cost but got some good responses from AEG staff on BGG about ""To The Barricades"" and the it's value. Bases on those facts, and the fact that I could add it to my pledge, I backed the campaign.

Today I got my email to set up my pledge manager. I went on less than four hours after I received the email and when I went to add my To The Barricades, it said sold out. It said copies were limited and there MIGHT be more available later, in August, well after the widow for refunds. This does not seem right or fair to me and feels like bait and switch. Neither statement above from Kickstarter page suggest anything about any kind of limited supply.

It appears many others are unhappy about this, but am I overreacting in being supremely annoyed by this?  Is this a violation of any of Kickstarters rules?  I've reached out to AEG in a number of emails and am really hoping they can rectify this, but unless the decide to offer the add-on to those who want it I would be very hesitant to back AEG Kickstarters in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Update 1:  They today posted an update on the Kickstarter.

**""Thunderstone Quest: New Horizons came to a successful conclusion on Kickstarter on June 28th. With the support of our backers on Kickstarter we were able to push forward and add Quest 8 Vengeful Sands and Quest 9 Clockwork Destiny to our production schedule!**

**Now it is time to open the Pledge Manager.**

**The Pledge Manager is a third-party tool that we use to collect information about your order, allow you to upgrade your order and select Add-ons, and pay any outstanding balance due.**

**It is also a Late Pledge system which allows anyone who missed the Kickstarter to place an order to be delivered at the same time with the same components in every respect as the Kickstarter Rewards and Add-ons.**

**The generic URL for the Pledge Manager is:**[**https://app.crowdox.com/projects/alderac/thunderstone-quest-...**](https://app.crowdox.com/projects/alderac/thunderstone-quest-new-horizons-from-aeg)

**If you backed the Kickstarter you will have received an email from the system with a URL to your individual order which you should use to complete the checkout process.**

**The Pledge Manager will be open at least through the end of July.4th Level Heroes Added to All New Horizons Rewards!**

**Because the community succeeded in achieving the $400,000 Stretch Goal, we've added the 4th Level Heroes Add-on to all Rewards containing the New Horizons Reward. If you had adjusted your pledge on Kickstarter to prepay for this Add-on, you'll notice that you have a $25 credit on your order on the Pledge Manager.**

**If you backed the campaign at the ""Your Inventory is Full"" level, we have reduced that Reward to $375 in the Pledge Manager, which means that your $400 pledge will generate a $25 credit.Expedited Rewards**

**If you selected one of the Expedited Rewards in the Kickstarter, and you want to get all the contents of the ""Your Inventory is Full"" pledge, here are the instructions you must follow. If you change your Reward selection to Your Inventory is Full, you will lose your Expedited Status. YOU WILL LOSE YOUR EXPEDITED STATUS IF YOU CHANGE YOUR REWARD TO YOUR INVENTORY IS FULL.**

**Use the default Expedited Reward that your order already has selectedOn the Add-on screen, select the ""Your Inventory is Full Add-on for Expedited Orders""**

**If you have any questions or concerns about altering your Expedited order please email** [**kickstarter@alderac.com**](mailto:kickstarter@alderac.com) **before making any changes and we'll be glad to help.**

**Additional Champion &amp; To the Barricades Add-OnsSupplies of Champion and To the Barricades are limited. As a result, we have configured the system to allow just 1 of each to be added to each order. And when they are sold out, we won't be able to offer any additional units.**

**If you have any questions or concerns please email** [**kickstarter@alderac.com**](mailto:kickstarter@alderac.com)**. This email address should be your primary point of contact with us regarding this Kickstarter; messages sent via Kickstarter, Facebook, BGG, or other communications channels are not necessarily going to be read and responded to.-- The AEG Thunderstone Team**

This mentions the limited stock but does not address the fact that all statements before made it clear that anyone who wanted To The Barricades would be able to add it. This is unfortunate and does seem to address concerns others have brought the their attention. I encourage anyone to email them at the address provided.

The PM closed the end of July, so well before the even decide on if more Barricades copies will be made. So even if I wanted to wait and see, I don't know how I would go about it. Just add 50 bucks and hope they decide to? What happens to my money if the decide not to? Would I be forced to use it on something I don't want or just lose it?

&amp;#x200B;

Update 2:  This was posted in the comments on the Kickstarter.

**@All - with regard to the availability (or lack thereof) of To the Barricades, no matter what the final outcome is, for any backer feels that they were not treated fairly with regard to this issue, we will offer a 100% refund of any portion or all of their pledge regardless of when they make that decision.**

&amp;#x200B;

I really appreciate this update and the fact that they are offering full refunds outside of the 7 days window.  Hopefully they will provide an update that still gives us an opportunity to get the ""To the Barricades"" content.",t2_oquv6,False,,0,False,Thunderstone Quest - Issues with latest Kickstarter,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Crowdfunding'}]",r/boardgames,False,6,,0,,False,t3_c8gyq0,False,dark,,public,19,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Crowdfunding,False,19,,self,1562185421.0,,[],{},,True,,1562140429.0,richtext,6,,text,self.boardgames,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATES AT BOTTOM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the campaign page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;To the Barricades (not shown)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will be able to order To the Barricades in the Pledge Manager as an Add-on. It will be priced at $50 + Shipping &amp;amp; Handling (approximately $15 for US backers). It will be identical to the previous Kickstarter Reward and will have all stretch goals in that Reward. We won&amp;#39;t be able to ship them Expedited unless they&amp;#39;re included in an Expedited Reward.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the FAQ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Can I order To The Barricades?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes! If you already have the base game (Retail, Adventurer or Champion) and you missed To the Barricades! you&amp;#39;ll be able to order it in the Pledge Manager. It will be $50 + Shipping &amp;amp; Handling.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had some reservations about backing the campaign based on the cost but got some good responses from AEG staff on BGG about &amp;quot;To The Barricades&amp;quot; and the it&amp;#39;s value. Bases on those facts, and the fact that I could add it to my pledge, I backed the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I got my email to set up my pledge manager. I went on less than four hours after I received the email and when I went to add my To The Barricades, it said sold out. It said copies were limited and there MIGHT be more available later, in August, well after the widow for refunds. This does not seem right or fair to me and feels like bait and switch. Neither statement above from Kickstarter page suggest anything about any kind of limited supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears many others are unhappy about this, but am I overreacting in being supremely annoyed by this?  Is this a violation of any of Kickstarters rules?  I&amp;#39;ve reached out to AEG in a number of emails and am really hoping they can rectify this, but unless the decide to offer the add-on to those who want it I would be very hesitant to back AEG Kickstarters in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 1:  They today posted an update on the Kickstarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Thunderstone Quest: New Horizons came to a successful conclusion on Kickstarter on June 28th. With the support of our backers on Kickstarter we were able to push forward and add Quest 8 Vengeful Sands and Quest 9 Clockwork Destiny to our production schedule!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now it is time to open the Pledge Manager.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Pledge Manager is a third-party tool that we use to collect information about your order, allow you to upgrade your order and select Add-ons, and pay any outstanding balance due.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is also a Late Pledge system which allows anyone who missed the Kickstarter to place an order to be delivered at the same time with the same components in every respect as the Kickstarter Rewards and Add-ons.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The generic URL for the Pledge Manager is:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://app.crowdox.com/projects/alderac/thunderstone-quest-new-horizons-from-aeg""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://app.crowdox.com/projects/alderac/thunderstone-quest-...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you backed the Kickstarter you will have received an email from the system with a URL to your individual order which you should use to complete the checkout process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Pledge Manager will be open at least through the end of July.4th Level Heroes Added to All New Horizons Rewards!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because the community succeeded in achieving the $400,000 Stretch Goal, we&amp;#39;ve added the 4th Level Heroes Add-on to all Rewards containing the New Horizons Reward. If you had adjusted your pledge on Kickstarter to prepay for this Add-on, you&amp;#39;ll notice that you have a $25 credit on your order on the Pledge Manager.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you backed the campaign at the &amp;quot;Your Inventory is Full&amp;quot; level, we have reduced that Reward to $375 in the Pledge Manager, which means that your $400 pledge will generate a $25 credit.Expedited Rewards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you selected one of the Expedited Rewards in the Kickstarter, and you want to get all the contents of the &amp;quot;Your Inventory is Full&amp;quot; pledge, here are the instructions you must follow. If you change your Reward selection to Your Inventory is Full, you will lose your Expedited Status. YOU WILL LOSE YOUR EXPEDITED STATUS IF YOU CHANGE YOUR REWARD TO YOUR INVENTORY IS FULL.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the default Expedited Reward that your order already has selectedOn the Add-on screen, select the &amp;quot;Your Inventory is Full Add-on for Expedited Orders&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have any questions or concerns about altering your Expedited order please email&lt;/strong&gt; [&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""mailto:kickstarter@alderac.com""&gt;kickstarter@alderac.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;](mailto:&lt;a href=""mailto:kickstarter@alderac.com""&gt;kickstarter@alderac.com&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;before making any changes and we&amp;#39;ll be glad to help.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Champion &amp;amp; To the Barricades Add-OnsSupplies of Champion and To the Barricades are limited. As a result, we have configured the system to allow just 1 of each to be added to each order. And when they are sold out, we won&amp;#39;t be able to offer any additional units.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have any questions or concerns please email&lt;/strong&gt; [&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""mailto:kickstarter@alderac.com""&gt;kickstarter@alderac.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;](mailto:&lt;a href=""mailto:kickstarter@alderac.com""&gt;kickstarter@alderac.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;strong&gt;. This email address should be your primary point of contact with us regarding this Kickstarter; messages sent via Kickstarter, Facebook, BGG, or other communications channels are not necessarily going to be read and responded to.-- The AEG Thunderstone Team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mentions the limited stock but does not address the fact that all statements before made it clear that anyone who wanted To The Barricades would be able to add it. This is unfortunate and does seem to address concerns others have brought the their attention. I encourage anyone to email them at the address provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PM closed the end of July, so well before the even decide on if more Barricades copies will be made. So even if I wanted to wait and see, I don&amp;#39;t know how I would go about it. Just add 50 bucks and hope they decide to? What happens to my money if the decide not to? Would I be forced to use it on something I don&amp;#39;t want or just lose it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2:  This was posted in the comments on the Kickstarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@All - with regard to the availability (or lack thereof) of To the Barricades, no matter what the final outcome is, for any backer feels that they were not treated fairly with regard to this issue, we will offer a 100% refund of any portion or all of their pledge regardless of when they make that decision.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

542,,boardgames,"So, with two playthroughs of Root under my belt (the first game will be a learning game, guaranteed), I feel like I can provide a little insight into some of the conflicting reviews of this game. 

First and foremost: this game is NOT for non-gamers, at least not for people who aren't excited about playing. The rules aren't incredibly difficult, but they add up, and keeping track of other players factions is near impossible for someone who isn't invested. This is actually where I think a few critics have gone wrong. This game is meant to be played as a light game for wargamers, or a heavy game for area control gamers. Yes, this game will be completed in 2 hours or less, but there is a lot of depth here that isn't immediately apparent. 

I must talk about my biggest flaw, or buying consideration, about this game after playing a couple times. Like SUSD said in their review, this game operates on the continuous balancing by players in terms of taking down the leader. There needs to be an understanding of who is winning and why, or else the game will never be satisfying. This leads to one reality I've discovered: you really have to play this game with the same people. I've played just twice, and if we were to swap one of the players in our group with a smart gamer who hadn't played, this player would be forced to trust us when we told them who was in the lead and why it was their responsibility to stop them. In something like Kemet, the VPs are easily trackable, and there's only a couple ways to get them. In Root, you have to track everyone else's game and ways of winning. It is so heavily asymmetrical, the burden of engagement is extremely high.

The thing is, I would not say this is to the detriment of the game. I appreciate a high buy in of engagement, and I won't knock a game for new players being disadvantaged. However, this all produces a very particular type of game flow and play experience:

Whether to it's detriment or not, Root is a game of constantly trying to score points while harming the leader, and the person who wins will often be the one who played an absolutely mediocre game until the very end. Sometimes, there are runaway leaders because people are too focused on their own factions (this will almost certainly happen in your first game). But more often, you will play a game of Root in which the winner never did anything ""crazy"" or ""awesome"". I know it's my first two plays, but from what I've read elsewhere online and what I've seen on YT playthroughs, my experience seems pretty consistent with others. Feel free to let me know if you disagree. 

My first impression of Root is actually positive, believe it or not. The production is the best I've ever seen at this price point, and the humdrum of managing your faction is actually quite fun and interesting, even if it's not highlighted by rushes of adrenaline or ""big-brain plays"". I've enjoyed my first two plays, and look forward to playing more. Moving forward, my biggest concern is the crunch of each individual faction. Could I play the same faction 10 times and have more fun each time, is there true depth to these factions? This is what I'll have to discover moving forward.

I started playing table top games in Middle School mainly as a **Warhammer 40k** and **DnD 3rd Edition** fan but enjoyed basic games like **Risk** and **Monopoly**. The first game that showed me the breadth of the hobby was **Conquest of the Empire** which my friends and I would play and argue over at sleepovers into the wee hours of the morning. I have fond memories of these session even though the playthroughs were often disastrous due to disagreements over the rules. Around this time I bought **Smallworld**, **Catan**, **Ticket to Ride**.

Soon after I bought **Agricola** which showed me the strategic depth of Euro games and worker placement games. My collection grew quite a bit in this era and games like **Eclipse**, **Dominant Species**, **Through the Ages**, and **Terra Mystica** remain some of my favorites.

About half of my games have been bought since I got **Food Chain Magnate** a year and a half ago. Most of these games are either heavy strategy games or good 2p games for my girlfriend and I to play. As my pre-order list probably indicates, I love Splotter games. I've played **Food Chain Magnate** about 15 times and it is probably my favorite game currently. I quite enjoy **Antiquity** too though it plays much differently.

About 8 months ago I got bit by the **18xx** bug. I discovered these games reading about the favorite games of game designers on this subreddit. I bought the Lookout games edition of **1830** and have played it 6 or 7 times. Each games flows in a very unique way and strategy must be adapted accordingly, which is not true of most other games in my collection.

I also want to mention one of the most unique games in my collection, **Techno Bowl**. This game is simple at face value but the strategy goes very deep as I have learned in the Discord TTS Techno Bowl league I am in. Its my favorite game that includes in-game luck elements.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not Shown&lt;/strong&gt;: TI3, TI4, Carcassonne Big Box, Techno Bowl&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-ordered&lt;/strong&gt;: Roads &amp;amp; Boats, Food Chain Magnate Expansion, Bus, Irish Gauge&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started playing table top games in Middle School mainly as a &lt;strong&gt;Warhammer 40k&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;DnD 3rd Edition&lt;/strong&gt; fan but enjoyed basic games like &lt;strong&gt;Risk&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Monopoly&lt;/strong&gt;. The first game that showed me the breadth of the hobby was &lt;strong&gt;Conquest of the Empire&lt;/strong&gt; which my friends and I would play and argue over at sleepovers into the wee hours of the morning. I have fond memories of these session even though the playthroughs were often disastrous due to disagreements over the rules. Around this time I bought &lt;strong&gt;Smallworld&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Catan&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Ticket to Ride&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after I bought &lt;strong&gt;Agricola&lt;/strong&gt; which showed me the strategic depth of Euro games and worker placement games. My collection grew quite a bit in this era and games like &lt;strong&gt;Eclipse&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Dominant Species&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Through the Ages&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Terra Mystica&lt;/strong&gt; remain some of my favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About half of my games have been bought since I got &lt;strong&gt;Food Chain Magnate&lt;/strong&gt; a year and a half ago. Most of these games are either heavy strategy games or good 2p games for my girlfriend and I to play. As my pre-order list probably indicates, I love Splotter games. I&amp;#39;ve played &lt;strong&gt;Food Chain Magnate&lt;/strong&gt; about 15 times and it is probably my favorite game currently. I quite enjoy &lt;strong&gt;Antiquity&lt;/strong&gt; too though it plays much differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 8 months ago I got bit by the &lt;strong&gt;18xx&lt;/strong&gt; bug. I discovered these games reading about the favorite games of game designers on this subreddit. I bought the Lookout games edition of &lt;strong&gt;1830&lt;/strong&gt; and have played it 6 or 7 times. Each games flows in a very unique way and strategy must be adapted accordingly, which is not true of most other games in my collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to mention one of the most unique games in my collection, &lt;strong&gt;Techno Bowl&lt;/strong&gt;. This game is simple at face value but the strategy goes very deep as I have learned in the Discord TTS Techno Bowl league I am in. Its my favorite game that includes in-game luck elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Games&lt;/strong&gt;: FCM, 1830, 1880 China, Terra Mystica, Techno Bowl&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prized Possessions&lt;/strong&gt;: 1822, 1880 China, Eclipse: Rise of the Ancients&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Un-played Games&lt;/strong&gt; (Unfortunately): 1822, 1856, 18CZ, Sidereal Confluence, Escape Plan, TI4, Duelosaur Island&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wishlist&lt;/strong&gt;: Spirit Island, Import / Export, Die Macher, OG Civilization, Other Splotters&lt;/p&gt;

My collection isn't too big (50-60), but I usually get around to playing most of my games in a year, which is a feat in this hobby nowadays. I've been finding myself wanting to buy new games, but I'm also trying to by games with different mechanics than I already have so I'm not doubling up on the ""types"" of games I own. So, *I need some help deciding what games to look into next to ""fill in the gaps"" of missing mechanics or maybe even suggestions of what to replace in my collection if another game does the same thing/mechanic better.* Here's are is a general list of mechanics along with the games I own that fit into those categories:

*Action Points*: **Blood Rage**

*Action/Role Selection*: **Race for the Galaxy/Puerto Rico** \-- Is there another game that does this better that I might be missing out on?

*Area Control/Area Influence*: **Blood Rage, The Godfather: Corleone's Empire.** Any better ones?

*Asymmetrical/Variable Player Powers:* **Android: Netrunner, Scythe**

*Auction/Bidding:* **Power Grid** and some others have it as a smaller mechanic in the game. I think this is one I'm lacking in?

*Co-op:* **Pandemic** and **Eldritch Horror**

*Deduction:* **The Resistance**

*Drafting:* **7 Wonders, Sushi Go,** and others have it in smaller ways (**Blood Rage, Godfather**)

*Deck Building:* **Dominion** \-- This is one that I always get stuck on. I've been thinking about getting **Clank! In! Space!** just to have a Deck Builder that is...a little bit of something more? Are there other games that fit this bill? I guess *Bag Building* would be a similar concept, and I really don't have any of those. What are the best?

*Dexterity:* **Jungle Speed** is the only one I have, but it doesn't hit the table very often at all. Any suggestions here?

*Dice Rolling:* **Dice Forge** is the best fit from my collection with others that obviously have it as a smaller mechanic. What are your favorite games when you just want to chuck dice?

*Engine Building:* **Scythe** or **Puerto Rico** to some extent? What are your favorites for this category?

*Hidden Movement:* **Fury of Dracula** only happens every so often. Do you have others that hit more often for your group?

*Party:* **Codenames, Cash 'n Guns**

*Real Time:* **Captain Sonar** and **Space Alert** (although, my group didn't get into Space Alert all that much)

*Teams:* **Captain Sonar, Codenames** \-- not sure what other good ones are...

*Tile Placement:* **Carcassonne** and **Azul** (not sure if this one fits here)

*Worker Placement:* **Agricola, Lords of Waterdeep, Dinosaur Island** 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now onto a couple mechanics I know I'm missing....

I have been in the hobby for about 2 years but I didn't go out of my way to purchase games until recently. I had a really good college friend who invited me and a couple other buds over to play quite regularly so I pretty much just mooched off him for games, such as Scythe, Secret Hitler, Pandemic. But, once we graduated college, we all moved across the state (Indiana) and made it difficult to continue meeting up, so I began to build up my own collection back in October 2018 to play with my roommate and other nearby friends who I introduced to board gaming!

If I would change one thing about my collection it would be to add some heavier games. I've built up a pretty solid collection of lighter/medium weight games but I really would like to take the next step. Feel free to recommend me something based off my collection to try out!

Favorite Game: Ghost Stories (I've beaten it 3 times out of the 10-12 times I've played, but it's just a blast and everyone I introduce it to loves it).

Newest Games: Decrypto and Century Spice Road (picked these up because they seemed to get really high reviews and I enjoyed the gameplay I saw of both.)

Kickstarter games that will be coming later this year (hopefully) is Carnival Zombie and Wavelength. 

I have played all these games at least once, I've always made an effort to play new games before returning to an older game I own. I don't really have a prized possession, probably Wingspan just because it's such a hot game and I'm really digging the theme.

The only game that may be leaving soon is Time Stories. I LOVED the Asylum case but honestly, The Marcy Case felt so dry and it wasn't as puzzly as I wanted. And after seeing all the backlash with Madame, I think I will just want for the 2nd implementation of the game.

Happy Tuesday, /r/boardgames!

This is a weekly thread to discuss train games and 18xx games, which are a family of economic train games consisting of shared ownership in railroad companies. For more information, [see the description on BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/19/18xx). There’s also a subreddit devoted entirely to 18xx games, /r/18xx, and a subreddit devoted entirely to **[Age of Steam](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4098/age-steam)**, /r/AgeOfSteam.

Here’s a nice guide on [how to get started with 18xx](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/4sygx3/how_to_get_started_with_18xx/?st=iqny4loj&amp;sh=c01b5d88).

Feel free to discuss anything about train games, including recent plays, what you're looking forward to, and any questions you have. 

If you want to arrange to play some 18xx or other train games online, feel free to try to arrange a game with people via /r/playboardgames.

562,,boardgames,"I’m now a C3 quadriplegic. I can no longer move or feel anything from the shoulders down. One of the hobbies that I really enjoy since my injury is boardgames. I actually host a boardgame group at my home every Saturday, but I still feel like I can’t quite get my fill of the hobby. While I use Board Game Arena to successfully scratch my itch from time to time, I’m wondering if Steam is viable for someone like myself.

The only reason I question whether Steam is something I could benefit from is because I now use voice recognition software (Dragon NaturallySpeaking, to be specific) in order to operate my computer. It’s a wonderful bit of software that allows me to do many things, but using it to control a mouse can be one of its more tedious allowances. While I’d really like to play some of the boardgames on Steam, I don’t know how much “mouse work” (drag-and-drop is particularly problematic) games often involve. A little drag-and-drop isn’t an automatic dealbreaker, but it’s a lot easier for me when the bulk of the “mouse work” involves simply clicking on stuff more than anything else. It's also highly problematic when I have to use coordinated keyboard and mouse actions in concert with each other. That would immediately render any game moot.

So, with those issues in mind, how viable do you folks believe Steam to be for a dude like me? The games I’m looking to play include, but are not limited to: Talisman, Scythe, Viticulture, Xia, Lords of Waterdeep, Castles of Burgundy, Terraforming Mars and the forthcoming GloomHaven. And if there are other games that you believe to be something I could play (boardgames or not), feel free to recommend all the titles I should check out.

You all have been a wonderful resource for me with prior boardgame-related inquiries, and I’m hoping you can come through for me once again. Many thanks in advance for all your input and inside, I genuinely appreciate it.

Before I started playing board games, I mostly just played cards with my family. We had tried out Catan and Ticket to Ride like most people started with, but I really didn't enjoy those, so I never really gave board games a chance. A friend started up a game night group and on the first night I played One Night Ultimate Werewolf and 7 Wonders. I hated them... The next week, I was hooked on both (I got burned out on one night pretty quick though).

I started buying board games almost a year ago, and my first purchase was Ethnos. I wouldn't say it's my least favorite game, as I do still believe it's a pretty good game, but it's the only game in my collection that I just refuse to play nowadays, because it was played multiple times a week for months on end due to it being the only 6 player game I had at the moment that was simple.

I quickly got into heavier, more strategic, games and bought Concordia, which is tied for my favorite game along with Brass: Birmingham and A Feast for Odin. I've been absolutely hooked on high strategy games and went on a (foolish) spending spree and bought a bunch of games in a way too short span of time.

I wouldn't change much about my collection. I could live without Hyperborea, as it has only made it to the table once, but I got it for free from the B2G1 free target deal. I do however wish I had more quick, simple games that I could play with my parents. They love Azul and Splendor, but they sort of struggle with complex games.

573,,boardgames,"\*cross-posting my reply to the original thread\*

Greetings.  I'm Eric J. Francis, the journalist who wrote [the Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-19/this-board-gaming-craze-comes-with-2-700-tables) (soft paywall). I  am only rarely on Reddit and didn't realize there had been a discussion  about it on here until I heard it mentioned on the So Very Wrong About  Games podcast. Here's more or less what I shared with them in response  to their comments and criticisms on the piece, many of which were also  raised here.

Let  me start by noting that the contract I signed with Bloomberg prohibits  me from sharing any communications between myself and my editor  regarding what changes were made and why, though I’ll go into as much  detail as I can in this post. It also prohibits me from sharing, for a  certain period after publication, the original draft, which was  substantially different from the published story – though, again, I’ll  go into as much detail as I can on that.

That stipulated, here's what I have to say. This will not be brief, but it will be thorough.

My  bona fides: On the gaming side, I'm a lifelong nerd, learned D&amp;D in  1979, and was introduced to my first hobby board game, Cosmic  Encounter, in '91. I became a serous board game nerd in the past five or  so years. On the journalism side, I got my first reporting job in 1991  and have been employed full-time or freelance in the field since then.  I’ve been a reporter, editor, and managing editor.

The  genesis of the Bloomberg story is this: I had freelanced for them back  in 2012, and earlier this year an editor I'd worked with sent out a  request for pitches. I already had the idea of writing about luxury  board gaming accessories, so I sent that in to him and he accepted. The  assignment was for 1,000 words.

Over  the course of the next few weeks I interviewed several serious board  gamers (I didn’t single out “rich people,” as suggested, but  crowdsourced folks through BGG and my local FLGS game night), several  manufacturers of accessories, and researched hobby board gaming trends  and statistics. My initial submission was about 1,300 words. Over the  course of the next couple of weeks, my editor got back to me with  multiple requests for additional information and interviews, and the  final draft I submitted was some 3,000 words long.

What  I can tell you about that draft: It included more from my interview  with Chris Stagno, more background info about the growth of the hobby,  more from each interview with the business owners, and -- crucially --  the overall draft told a cohesive story.

A  lot of that didn't make it into the final cut, obviously. Why? Two  reasons. The first is that while there is technically no limit to space  on the internet, online news organizations that pay by the word do not  subscribe to this philosophy. And secondly, while I was writing from the  perspective of a gamer, the ultimate audience my editor was responsible  for is not gamers but businesspeople and folks with money, and he had  to make sure the article addressed them. (Props to Brodogmillionaire1  for hitting that nail on the head in his comment!)

The  cold fact is, this article wasn't for board gamers and the editor did  not tailor it to them as an audience. That’s the reason behind many of  the editing choices.

Take the headline.  Firstly, reporters do not generally get to write them. I suggested a  different one: ""Introducing the $4,500 board game night."" This fit the  narrative I had created, which talked about how it was possible (not  required, but possible) for avid gamers with enough income to spend a  whole lot of money to pimp their game night. When the editor responded  with the one you saw, I went to bat for my original headline. I didn't  get my way.

And then there's the ""if  you want to play and play it right"" line. Oy, vey! Trust me, that one  grates on me every bit as much as it does on you. My first draft said  something along the lines of ""But if you want to play it like a  hard-core board game hobbyist...,"" with a clear reference to ones with  disposable incomes; by the final draft, that was gone completely. When  the edit came back with the ""and play it right"" line, I suggested  switching to my first-draft phrasing – I even said to him something  like, ""You can play it right if you're sitting in the dirt"" -- but again  he was editing to suit his audience, and that's clearly an audience  that thinks ""doing it right"" means doing it in a way that flaunts your  cash flow.

My editor wasn't a board  gamer but he is an old D&amp;Der, which at least meant he was familiar  with the history of nerd gaming culture. But he also leaned a little  heavier on the D&amp;D angle than I would have liked -- the references  to playing in basements, pegging D&amp;D as the progenitor of modern  board games (the original draft talked about Catan's arrival in the U.S.  sparking the hobby here), etc. He felt that D&amp;D was well-known  enough among his audience to provide a touchstone for readers. I  disagreed with the way he implemented it but, again, reporters  (especially freelancers) generally don't have that much sway over final  content.

Reducing the draft from 3,000  to 1,600 published words also meant that all of the interviews were cut  pretty deeply. Again, I'm a narrative journalist, so every interview  section was a self-contained arc. The editor cut out all but what he  felt was the most relevant parts. In my comments I tried plugging some  stuff back in but, again, there he had a word count target. I'm  impressed he went as long as he did in the final version, given the  assignment was for 1,000 words.

I'll  close by reinforcing the fact that I would love -- LOVE -- to combine my  nerd and professional lives and become a go-to professional board games  journalist for mainstream outlets. But the caveat for board gamers will  always be that those outlets (especially niche outlets like Bloomberg)  are NOT aimed at board gamers as a core audience, and most likely what  gets published will not fully satisfy hobbyists. Believe me, if there  was a Nerd Monthly magazine out there paying professional rates for  articles that delved deeply into the hobby and issues surrounding it,  I'd be doing my damndest to write for every single issue. But there  isn't. The hobby-related publications out there either pay nothing or a  trifle -- and part of the reason is, to be frank, there's no demand.  Effectively no one in the hobby is clamoring to pay for professional  journalism content about board gaming, since there is a lot of semi-pro  and amateur content available for free.

I  hope this added perspective on the process my story went through  between the final draft and the published article is useful to y’all. I  knew when it came out that many of the edits wouldn’t sit well with a  lot of gamers. My hope is, though, that by getting an article about the  hobby into Bloomberg, it’s going to create more opportunities for  professional journalist/gamers like myself to do more reporting about it  and reach broader audiences, and ultimately grow the hobby as a result.

I’ll do my best to check in on [r/boardgames](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/)  every now and then so I can keep up with the community here, and answer  questions about this article (and, hopefully, others in the future).

&lt;p&gt;Greetings.  I&amp;#39;m Eric J. Francis, the journalist who wrote &lt;a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-19/this-board-gaming-craze-comes-with-2-700-tables""&gt;the Bloomberg article&lt;/a&gt; (soft paywall). I  am only rarely on Reddit and didn&amp;#39;t realize there had been a discussion  about it on here until I heard it mentioned on the So Very Wrong About  Games podcast. Here&amp;#39;s more or less what I shared with them in response  to their comments and criticisms on the piece, many of which were also  raised here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let  me start by noting that the contract I signed with Bloomberg prohibits  me from sharing any communications between myself and my editor  regarding what changes were made and why, though I’ll go into as much  detail as I can in this post. It also prohibits me from sharing, for a  certain period after publication, the original draft, which was  substantially different from the published story – though, again, I’ll  go into as much detail as I can on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That stipulated, here&amp;#39;s what I have to say. This will not be brief, but it will be thorough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My  bona fides: On the gaming side, I&amp;#39;m a lifelong nerd, learned D&amp;amp;D in  1979, and was introduced to my first hobby board game, Cosmic  Encounter, in &amp;#39;91. I became a serous board game nerd in the past five or  so years. On the journalism side, I got my first reporting job in 1991  and have been employed full-time or freelance in the field since then.  I’ve been a reporter, editor, and managing editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The  genesis of the Bloomberg story is this: I had freelanced for them back  in 2012, and earlier this year an editor I&amp;#39;d worked with sent out a  request for pitches. I already had the idea of writing about luxury  board gaming accessories, so I sent that in to him and he accepted. The  assignment was for 1,000 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over  the course of the next few weeks I interviewed several serious board  gamers (I didn’t single out “rich people,” as suggested, but  crowdsourced folks through BGG and my local FLGS game night), several  manufacturers of accessories, and researched hobby board gaming trends  and statistics. My initial submission was about 1,300 words. Over the  course of the next couple of weeks, my editor got back to me with  multiple requests for additional information and interviews, and the  final draft I submitted was some 3,000 words long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What  I can tell you about that draft: It included more from my interview  with Chris Stagno, more background info about the growth of the hobby,  more from each interview with the business owners, and -- crucially --  the overall draft told a cohesive story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A  lot of that didn&amp;#39;t make it into the final cut, obviously. Why? Two  reasons. The first is that while there is technically no limit to space  on the internet, online news organizations that pay by the word do not  subscribe to this philosophy. And secondly, while I was writing from the  perspective of a gamer, the ultimate audience my editor was responsible  for is not gamers but businesspeople and folks with money, and he had  to make sure the article addressed them. (Props to Brodogmillionaire1  for hitting that nail on the head in his comment!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The  cold fact is, this article wasn&amp;#39;t for board gamers and the editor did  not tailor it to them as an audience. That’s the reason behind many of  the editing choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the headline.  Firstly, reporters do not generally get to write them. I suggested a  different one: &amp;quot;Introducing the $4,500 board game night.&amp;quot; This fit the  narrative I had created, which talked about how it was possible (not  required, but possible) for avid gamers with enough income to spend a  whole lot of money to pimp their game night. When the editor responded  with the one you saw, I went to bat for my original headline. I didn&amp;#39;t  get my way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;if  you want to play and play it right&amp;quot; line. Oy, vey! Trust me, that one  grates on me every bit as much as it does on you. My first draft said  something along the lines of &amp;quot;But if you want to play it like a  hard-core board game hobbyist...,&amp;quot; with a clear reference to ones with  disposable incomes; by the final draft, that was gone completely. When  the edit came back with the &amp;quot;and play it right&amp;quot; line, I suggested  switching to my first-draft phrasing – I even said to him something  like, &amp;quot;You can play it right if you&amp;#39;re sitting in the dirt&amp;quot; -- but again  he was editing to suit his audience, and that&amp;#39;s clearly an audience  that thinks &amp;quot;doing it right&amp;quot; means doing it in a way that flaunts your  cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My editor wasn&amp;#39;t a board  gamer but he is an old D&amp;amp;Der, which at least meant he was familiar  with the history of nerd gaming culture. But he also leaned a little  heavier on the D&amp;amp;D angle than I would have liked -- the references  to playing in basements, pegging D&amp;amp;D as the progenitor of modern  board games (the original draft talked about Catan&amp;#39;s arrival in the U.S.  sparking the hobby here), etc. He felt that D&amp;amp;D was well-known  enough among his audience to provide a touchstone for readers. I  disagreed with the way he implemented it but, again, reporters  (especially freelancers) generally don&amp;#39;t have that much sway over final  content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reducing the draft from 3,000  to 1,600 published words also meant that all of the interviews were cut  pretty deeply. Again, I&amp;#39;m a narrative journalist, so every interview  section was a self-contained arc. The editor cut out all but what he  felt was the most relevant parts.

How do you feel about to have a hand of cards that are square-shaped instead of the usual poker card ratio?
Some games use the square-shaped cards but mostly you pick a card from a selection and play it (like El Grande).
How do you feel to keep cards with such shape in your hand for a longer period of time (like Magic)?
Does it really matter at all?

A forum to sell or trade your boardgames.

##Formatting Trade Listings:

- When listing games, you MUST include this information:
  - Game Edition/year
  - Box Condition
  - Component Condition
  - any other relevant information
- Be specific! Don't exaggerate or lie about condition. We will be very strict about this, and if we have a single problem here, we are scrapping this feature, and banning the offender(s). You will leave feedback for your trade partner.
- Please list your location that you will be shipping from.
- Tags for the games in your listing:
  - [H] - Have (games you have you are willing to trade).
  - [W] - Want (games you are looking to trade for).
  - [FS] - For Sale. (If you are looking to sell the game for money). Please include details, such as an asking price.
  - [FT] - For Trade (If you are looking to trade your game for another game).

##Logistics:

- If you are interested in an offer, leave a comment under their listing, and/or PM them about a potential trade. Be civil and courteous.
- The buyer will pay the shipping costs, unless you plan to work out your own arrangements. Be mindful of geography. Use shipping tracking numbers, and share them with your trade partner.
- Shippers will refer to this guide on shipping/packaging games. Poor shipping practices are unacceptable. Use tracking numbers and communicate them with your partner!
- Both parties will leave feedback underneath the comment in the Bazaar thread. Be truthful, and blunt. (Also, it is recommended that you setup/leave trade feedback through BGG).
- Spell your items correctly, in full. (for search purposes).

&lt;li&gt;If you are interested in an offer, leave a comment under their listing, and/or PM them about a potential trade. Be civil and courteous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The buyer will pay the shipping costs, unless you plan to work out your own arrangements. Be mindful of geography. Use shipping tracking numbers, and share them with your trade partner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shippers will refer to this guide on shipping/packaging games. Poor shipping practices are unacceptable. Use tracking numbers and communicate them with your partner!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both parties will leave feedback underneath the comment in the Bazaar thread. Be truthful, and blunt. (Also, it is recommended that you setup/leave trade feedback through BGG).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spell your items correctly, in full. (for search purposes).&lt;/li&gt;

597,,boardgames," 

Hello! I'm cross-posting this from /r/HelpMeFind.  Hopefully that's okay.

I've worked with my brother to try and find a board game that he and I played as kids (we're both in our late 30's now), and are unable to find the exact title. Hopefully someone out there can help!

The game was sort of like Clue, where you're looking to uncover how a crime was committed. It wasn't really a board game (no game pieces), but had individual flash cards that were about 5in x 5in in size. On one side of each card was a picture of the crime scene, and then on the back side, I believe there was a description of the incident you were asked to solve for.

To reveal the answer to the case, there was an area that you could place a red lens over-top to revel the text hidden within (similar to the game Password).

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve worked with my brother to try and find a board game that he and I played as kids (we&amp;#39;re both in our late 30&amp;#39;s now), and are unable to find the exact title. Hopefully someone out there can help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game was sort of like Clue, where you&amp;#39;re looking to uncover how a crime was committed. It wasn&amp;#39;t really a board game (no game pieces), but had individual flash cards that were about 5in x 5in in size. On one side of each card was a picture of the crime scene, and then on the back side, I believe there was a description of the incident you were asked to solve for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reveal the answer to the case, there was an area that you could place a red lens over-top to revel the text hidden within (similar to the game Password).&lt;/p&gt;

Today's article will be a little shorter than normal to make up for the huge amount of content that will be included in the next one.

Now that I had a giant list of thematic elements and numbers to draw from, it became time to create the first draft of Shifting Desert’s Spirit Board

**Innate Powers**

It was obvious from the start that I wanted one Innate Power to be gathering and one to be devouring. So here was my first stab at the Innate Powers:

* The Ravenous Hunger Devours
   * Slow, Range 0, Sand only
   * Threshold #1: 1 Earth, 1 Air, 1 Sun
      * Deal 2 Damage.
   * Threshold #2: 3 Earth, 2 Air, 3 Sun
      * Instead, deal 4 Damage.
   * Threshold #3: 5 Earth, 3 Air, 4 Sun
      * Instead, deal 10 Damage.
* Mirage Leads to Certain Demise
   * Fast, Range 0, Sand only
   * Threshold #1: 3 Sun
      * Gather 1 Explorer.
   * Threshold #2: 6 Sun
      * Gather 1 Town.
   * Threshold #3: 1 Air
      * For each Air you may repeat the Power (different lands are ok)

Note: I was about to learn about the nuances of Gathering by making this Spirit.

**Presence Tracks**

I decided I wanted to mimic something similar to Vital Strength of the Earth with play style. This meant low Card Plays and high amounts of energy. This lends itself well to playing Major Powers later in the game. Since I still wanted to trigger the Innate Powers with relatively few Card Plays, I needed to add Elements to the Presence Tracks. This proved to be a lot more difficult than I had originally thought. This explains why all the Low Complexity Spirits don’t have Elements on their Presence Tracks, which is actually a hard rule set by the designers.

So here’s my first attempt at the layout of the Presence Tracks on the Spirit Panel:

* Energy Track:
   * 2 Sun 4 Sun 6 Air 8 9
* Card Plays Track:
   * 1 Earth 2 Earth/Reclaim-1 Air 3

**Growth Options**

Here’s what I came up with for the Growth options:

* Reclaim All, Gain a Power Card
* Add a Presence (R3), Gain a Power Card
* Add a Presence (R0), Gain 2 Energy and +2 more per Sun showing
   * Note: this could net a maximum of 6 Energy when all Sun symbols were showing.

In my mind, there were enough Elements to get the Innate Powers triggered assuming all 3 Card Plays had Earth Symbols on them and if there were any Plant or Water Elements on the cards, I should have plenty of Sun Elements to trigger the other Innate Power.

With that, the Spirit (rough draft) was complete. I put it all into effect on a template in Inkscape and printed it out, eager for my first game to see how I did.

**The First Play-Test**

We played a 2-player game of Difficulty 4 of Brandenburg-Prussia to see how it held up against a slightly harder version of the base game. My wife played River (she always randomizes which Spirit she plays unless we’re doing something insane like higher level England). As we played through the game and eventually won, I was furiously taking notes on the Spirit Panel of things that I noticed and things I wanted to experiment with and change.

Here’s a summary of what I learned from the first play-test:

**Special Rules:**

* Gathering when placing Presence as a Special Rule is definitely too powerful. It completely invalidates Build and Explore actions in their entirety with no cost to the player.
   * It could be interesting if it was only Gathering things like Dahan, Beasts, or other things.
* The Ravenous Hunger Devours (Innate Power #1) felt good, but wasn’t enough to deal with everything.
   * It was also too hard to trigger anything beyond the first threshold.
* Mirage Leads to Certain Demise (Innate Power #2) felt really good thematically, but was too powerful in practice. Most likely was because it was a fast Power. Slowing it down would help me understand how it should be balanced.
   * Repeating this power with 1 Air made the game trivial. If I wanted to Gather multiple Invaders, I was going to have to earn it.

**Presence Tracks:**

* Definitely needed to redo the Presence Tracks. The Elements came at strange times and didn’t make sense.
* It seemed like I was just trying to avoid repetition on the Tracks (i.e. 2 2 2 3 4 5) and opted to fill the “useless” spaces with Elements instead. It didn’t work out the way I had hoped.
* The Energy gain was too high and Energy was never an issue, even in the early stages (also a fault of the Growth options).

**Growth Options:**

* Gaining 2 per Sun Element showing was definitely too powerful.
   * Considered changing it to a passive gain 3 with another 1 per Sun instead.
   * Or removing that component of it entirely.

**Unique Power Cards:**

* Bottomless Pits of Quicksand
   * It felt weird to add Wilds, Destroy an Explorer, AND Defend 4. There were instances where I’d play the card just to put a Wild down. That didn’t feel good at all.
   * I did like having a defensive ability, but I think there is a better way to implement one.
* Scorch with Desert Heat
   * It felt like it should either Cost 1 Energy or be Fast
   * The rest of it felt good.
* Singing Dunes of Sand
   * I liked the thematic part of it, but Gathering 2 Explorers (even slow) was too powerful and essentially negated the Explore action (and therefore the subsequent Build and Ravage actions).
   * Doing all of that AND adding 2 Fear was definitely too much.
* Thrashing Walls of Sand
   * Again, this accompanied with everything else made it so that I only had to deal with Explorers and Towns. The Invaders couldn’t ever get a hold long enough to Build a City throughout the entirety of the game.

**General Thoughts:**

* Turns out Gathering as a Fast Power is really powerful. I gained a new respect for all Power Cards that Gather or Push fast. To be fair, Gathering multiple things even as a Slow Power is incredibly powerful as well.

So there you have it. The Spirit was definitely too powerful for its own good. I nixed the Special Rule about gathering after the first round. It was obvious that it was too powerful after the first time I did it.

You can learn a lot from a single play-test and anyone who has ever made a game will tell you that it takes dozens (perhaps even hundreds) of play-tests and iterations before you come up with a solid design.

Next time I’ll talk about some advice I read from the designers that really changed my outlook on things and how my entire mindset shifted as a result.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, deal 10 Damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mirage Leads to Certain Demise

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast, Range 0, Sand only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threshold #1: 3 Sun

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather 1 Explorer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threshold #2: 6 Sun

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather 1 Town.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threshold #3: 1 Air

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each Air you may repeat the Power (different lands are ok)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growth Options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The Energy gain was too high and Energy was never an issue, even in the early stages (also a fault of the Growth options).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growth Options:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaining 2 per Sun Element showing was definitely too powerful.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Considered changing it to a passive gain 3 with another 1 per Sun instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or removing that component of it entirely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique Power Cards:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bottomless Pits of Quicksand

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It felt weird to add Wilds, Destroy an Explorer, AND Defend 4. There were instances where I’d play the card just to put a Wild down. That didn’t feel good at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did like having a defensive ability, but I think there is a better way to implement one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scorch with Desert Heat

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It felt like it should either Cost 1 Energy or be Fast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rest of it felt good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Singing Dunes of Sand

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I liked the thematic part of it, but Gathering 2 Explorers (even slow) was too powerful and essentially negated the Explore action (and therefore the subsequent Build and Ravage actions).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing all of that AND adding 2 Fear was definitely too much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thrashing Walls of Sand

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again, this accompanied with everything else made it so that I only had to deal with Explorers and Towns. The Invaders couldn’t ever get a hold long enough to Build a City throughout the entirety of the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Thoughts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turns out Gathering as a Fast Power is really powerful. I gained a new respect for all Power Cards that Gather or Push fast. To be fair, Gathering multiple things even as a Slow Power is incredibly powerful as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you have it. The Spirit was definitely too powerful for its own good. I nixed the Special Rule about gathering after the first round. It was obvious that it was too powerful after the first time I did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can learn a lot from a single play-test and anyone who has ever made a game will tell you that it takes dozens (perhaps even hundreds) of play-tests and iterations before you come up with a solid design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time I’ll talk about some advice I read from the designers that really changed my outlook on things and how my entire mindset shifted as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts or things that stuck out to you? I&amp;#39;d love to discuss!&lt;/p&gt;

608,,boardgames,"I'm wondering if anyone can share some thoughts about Antike II.

I'm relatively new to the hobby but have found myself to be a big fan of Mac Gerdts. I have Concordia and Navegador and they are two of my favourite games. I find them to have fantastically smooth flow, interesting decisions without excessive complexity and elegant, interlocking mechanisms. In Concordia, I love the variable setup with the cities and available cards as well as the card play. Navegador has the wonderful market and rondel systems. Both have great use of scoring multipliers.

I'm wondering whether or not I will like Antike II. It seems to be the next most-recommended game by this designer apart from Imperial (/2030) which I'd rather avoid for a few reasons (don't like the theme, not a big fan of stock-ownership games or the idea of indirect control over countries).

Antike II seems to be quite a different beast in terms of its inherent direct conflict and race to fulfill victory conditions. The groups I play with tend to be more on the ""care bear"" side of things and prefer the passive conflict of euro games. I  worry about non-aggressive players getting ""shut-out"" of the game and having a bad time. I also wonder if, as an older game, despite the 2014 update, the mechanisms may feel a little dated and dry.

On the other hand, I'm hoping the game might have the smoothness and tight design of the other Mac Gerdts games I've tried.

Is this game still getting a lot of play for you? Does the combat avoid being too arbitrary or ""take-that""?  Is it possible to thrive with a non-combat strategy? Is the game too intimidating or un-fun for newbies? Does the game play OK at 3 (my most common player count) or does it really need the 5 recommended by BGG?

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;#hmm&lt;/code&gt; means that something about the project seems a little off. Buyer beware kinda thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;#lolwut&lt;/code&gt; is reserved for projects that seem like copycat games or campaigns put together with little thought. Check &amp;#39;em out for amusement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;#take&lt;/code&gt; tags are for projects that have been restarted for some reason, with the number indicating what iteration we&amp;#39;re currently on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did I miss something? Particularly something &lt;strong&gt;new in the last 7 days&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;ending in the next 7 days&lt;/strong&gt;? Let me know in the comments and I&amp;#39;ll add it in.&lt;/li&gt;

615,,boardgames,"Want to know what your opinion is on playing politically in Seven Wonders, for example, making deals with other players where it's mutually beneficial or teaming up against the person who's ahead.

For example, my brother and sister and I were playing, my sister was far ahead on science and we needed to deny her green cards to catch up. I was holding 2 green cards and said to my brother (who I was passing to next), if I discard this green card will you discard the next one when I pass you this hand? 

Or in a new game I needed to play the last loom so my brother didn't starve us for future ages, but I also wanted to play a better card, so I asked my sister to play the loom when I passed to her if I didn't play a card that would negatively affect her. 

My brother is very against this type of gameplay and says that we shouldn't be allowed to reveal what's in our hands to each other and it's against the rules. I said to him that there's nothing in the rulebook that stops us from making deals with each other and as long as we can communicate, barter politics is fine.

I've always assumed that crap games like Monopoly etc are most popular because they're most readily available, but I'm starting to think it's not that simple.

Of the 'hobby games', some of the most popular are also some of the most poorly designed - Betrayal at House on the Hill, Munchkin, Fluxx etc.

Some may argue these games have some merits, and they do, but I think it's easy to make the case that there are much better options.

It's also not the simplicity of games - Monopoly isn't actually that rules light, and there are a ton of very light party/filler hobby games that don't get nearly as much love as their 'bad' counterparts.

618,,boardgames,"They're usually more organized than this but here is my 2 year collection. Not pictured is 7 Wonders: Duel which is at a friend's house. Also not pictured is D&amp;D core books,10 Magic guild kit decks, tons of Star Wars: Destiny cards/dice, some Pokemon stuff and some more KeyForge stuff (I really like card games). And Fireball Island is on the way. As you can see, most of my collection falls in the light-medium range because that's mostly the audience I play with. I'll probably stop at 100 games and will definitely be adding some heavier hitters like Brass and Eclipse but for now keeping it on the lighter side.  


If I had to get rid of 10 games though they would probably be:  Last Night on Earth, Tiny Epic Western, Vault Wars, Ars Alchimia, Dude, Nyet!, Arkham Horror LCG, Valley of the Kings, Oceanos, and maybe Flick Em Up.  

&amp;#x200B;

LNOE because while I think the characters and mini's are really cool, there's just better zombie games out at this point so I'd probably swap it for Dead of Winter or Zombicide. Tiny Epic Western because the game doesn't really intrigue me that much and I haven't had the urge to play it more than a couple times. Vault Wars...still never played it so maybe I should before I get rid of it. Ars Alchimia was an impulse buy that I also haven't played but I like the manga style artwork. Dude is a one trick pony and I have better party games but this game is great to play with a table full of drunk people. Nyet! is a solid trick taking game and the art is great but I want a little bit more out of it, maybe I'll play it some more before selling. Arkham Horror LCG is a great game but I don't have anyone to play it with to make buying past the core box worth it and its just a lot of money to sink into one game, even if it is good. Valley of the Kings is a very unique deckbuilder but the art is just...bad. Oceanos is like baby 7 Wonders and its a solid drafting game but after 10 plays its not that interesting to me. Flick Em Up is a game that I think sounds great in theory and then in practice its kind of a mixed bag (this is the plastic one though so that could be why).

&amp;#x200B;

Recent games I'm really stoked on are Chronicles of Crime, Decrypto and Welcome To. What do you think of the games I want to get rid of? Agree? Or should I keep some? I'd love to hear your opinions because I feel like I haven't given some of those games a fair chance.

628,,boardgames,"In recent years there has been a real interest in Japanese games. A number have been brought to the market in English editions, and that what has happened here with [**Long Live the Queen**](http://ludicreations.com/product/long-live-queen-classic-edition/). This clever two player game was originally published in Japan by Circle3D6. With the help of LudiCreations, it was finally brought to a wider audience with the help of a crowd-funded project that produced two editions: one that retained the Japanese art and theme, and a second version that used the diesel-punk theme of another LudiCreations game. There were other component changes as well, including larger tiles, a revised graphic design, plus expanded rules and some other new components that would help with the game-play. The result was a clever two-player game with a choice of two fine editions.  I opted to get the version with the Japanese styled art, so that's what I'll primarily be describing, but the game-play is identical with the diesel-punk version.

**Overview**

In Long Live the Queen, two players go head-to-head in a tactical game where they each play one of the queen's two daughters. Now that the queen has died, we must seek to persuade the members of the court to support our quest to become the new queen. To do that, we need to cleverly make use of our court personnel.  Both players have a line of 11 face-down characters opposite each other, corresponding to the possible outcomes of rolling two standard dice. The dice then activate the characters: those corresponding to the rolled number are flipped face up, or their abilities trigger.  

There are two different ways to win, either by being the first to get three of each prestige token, or by eliminating the opponent's princess.  Triggering the special abilities of our characters will get us the prestige we need in three main areas: might (red), wealth (yellow), and wisdom (blue). Alternatively, using our Assassin or Sniper on our competitor princess will also gain us victory. These two paths to victory are reasonably balanced, with a prestige win being more common, but your strategy will also depend on how your opponent plays.  In the inevitable tactical battle and see-saw struggle that will follow, will our princess come out on top, and become the next queen?

**Impressions**

LudiCreations have done an excellent job of bringing Long Live the Queen to English speaking audiences, and to a wider market. While coming up with a new theme and artwork, they have made the sensible choice of preserving the original anime style artwork as well, so that consumers can make their own choice about which they prefer. Certainly the components are excellent, with sturdy cardboard tiles and attractive dice being part of the package, along with wonderful artwork that I can't praise highly enough.

As for the game-play, it's a fine two player game which does exactly what it sets out to do, which is serve as a fast and highly tactical filler game with a light feel. Granted, it won't be everyone's cup of tea, and the amount of luck was the major reason why some didn't enjoy the game. Granted, the dice do play a significant role in determining the outcome - but that's to be expected in most games involving dice. But that doesn't mean that there are no meaningful decisions. The choices that you make, especially in how you arrange your characters, are still very important, and more often than not will determine the winner.

Each turn you also have opportunity to switch two of your adjacent tiles, or substitute which will be your ""Master"" ability that determines what your two ""Apprentice"" tiles do. So the overall positional set-up you opt for at the start of your game, and how you manipulate it during the game, is critical. The location of your Guard - which can protect your princess - is also very important. Two other very important tiles are the Assassin and Sniper, since these can take your opponent's characters out of action. Alternatively, you can focus on an income generating strategy that revolves around earning prestige chips before your opponent does. Whatever your strategy, it's certainly not purely random, because how your characters relate positionally with respect to each other and to your opponent will often prove decisive, even though you will still need to roll the right numbers.

Some players reported that the game dragged, and our first game felt like this a little too. But once you're familiar with the characters and their respective abilities, the game moves along quite nicely, and the length feels about right given how light the game actually is. Just try not to take too long about which characters to move at the end of your turn. You still need luck to be on your side to win, but clever play will make a difference. And given how quick the game can play, having the outcome influenced by luck is quite acceptable.

**Recommendation**

In the end, Long Live the  Queen will especially please those looking for a light two player game, and who enjoy a sharply tactical and positional game with some secret information that gives scope for bluffing, while at the same time allowing a generous amount of luck courtesy of the dice. Imagine combining the positional feel of Chess, with the tactical bluffing of Stratego, and the dice rolling of Catan. Now wrap it all up into a gorgeous package with unique artwork, and give it the feel and length of a filler. That's effectively what you get with Long Live the Queen. I for one am very pleased that LudiCreations has helped bring this fun and fast two-player game out of Japan, and shared it with the rest of the world.

***Where to get it?*** *Long Live the Queen is available from the publisher LudiCreations (*[*Classic Edition*](http://ludicreations.com/product/long-live-queen-classic-edition/) *or* [*Dieselpunk Edition*](http://ludicreations.com/product/long-live-queen-dieselpunk-edition/)*)*.",t2_1k126tck,False,,0,False,Impressions of Long Live The Queen from LudiCreations and Japan,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Review'}]",r/boardgames,False,6,review,0,,False,t3_c7o7sd,False,dark,,public,9,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Review,False,9,,self,1561956358.0,,[],{},,True,,1561984893.0,richtext,6,,text,self.boardgames,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years there has been a real interest in Japanese games. A number have been brought to the market in English editions, and that what has happened here with &lt;a href=""http://ludicreations.com/product/long-live-queen-classic-edition/""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long Live the Queen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This clever two player game was originally published in Japan by Circle3D6. With the help of LudiCreations, it was finally brought to a wider audience with the help of a crowd-funded project that produced two editions: one that retained the Japanese art and theme, and a second version that used the diesel-punk theme of another LudiCreations game. There were other component changes as well, including larger tiles, a revised graphic design, plus expanded rules and some other new components that would help with the game-play. The result was a clever two-player game with a choice of two fine editions.  I opted to get the version with the Japanese styled art, so that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ll primarily be describing, but the game-play is identical with the diesel-punk version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Long Live the Queen, two players go head-to-head in a tactical game where they each play one of the queen&amp;#39;s two daughters. Now that the queen has died, we must seek to persuade the members of the court to support our quest to become the new queen. To do that, we need to cleverly make use of our court personnel.  Both players have a line of 11 face-down characters opposite each other, corresponding to the possible outcomes of rolling two standard dice. The dice then activate the characters: those corresponding to the rolled number are flipped face up, or their abilities trigger.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two different ways to win, either by being the first to get three of each prestige token, or by eliminating the opponent&amp;#39;s princess.  Triggering the special abilities of our characters will get us the prestige we need in three main areas: might (red), wealth (yellow), and wisdom (blue). Alternatively, using our Assassin or Sniper on our competitor princess will also gain us victory. These two paths to victory are reasonably balanced, with a prestige win being more common, but your strategy will also depend on how your opponent plays.  In the inevitable tactical battle and see-saw struggle that will follow, will our princess come out on top, and become the next queen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impressions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LudiCreations have done an excellent job of bringing Long Live the Queen to English speaking audiences, and to a wider market. While coming up with a new theme and artwork, they have made the sensible choice of preserving the original anime style artwork as well, so that consumers can make their own choice about which they prefer. Certainly the components are excellent, with sturdy cardboard tiles and attractive dice being part of the package, along with wonderful artwork that I can&amp;#39;t praise highly enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the game-play, it&amp;#39;s a fine two player game which does exactly what it sets out to do, which is serve as a fast and highly tactical filler game with a light feel. Granted, it won&amp;#39;t be everyone&amp;#39;s cup of tea, and the amount of luck was the major reason why some didn&amp;#39;t enjoy the game.

But that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that there are no meaningful decisions.

632,,boardgames,"Hello r/boardgames, this is my first post here or anywhere, but I have a nagging curiosity.

Recently, I came across a local board game designer/distributor at a shop who was demo'ing his newest board game which, as a self-proclaimed board game enthusiast, I found quite enjoyable. Fast forward to many dollars spent and some limited communications, I was fairly inspired to start my own venture into making board games as a hobby (a very, very new hobby.) And as such decided to prevail upon the one person I knew who did this as a hobby for advice and perhaps a small amount of guidance.

I was surprised and somewhat disheartened to learn that he felt it a miracle whenever he sold a game. I understand that he is a small time, mostly self published, designer but he does work with many local game stores for the releases of his games and also has done a number of Kickstarters. My major question, and worry as a newly declared designer, is this;

Are board game enthusiasts willing to give the little guys a shot?

I know in my own life that I am an impulse buyer, which is the biggest reason I bought the initial game. But I was pleased by my further purchases, they weren't all winners of my preferences, but still worth a play. But what would need to be done, in your eyes, to increase the chances of buying the non-brand game over a big brand game?

I hope this doesn't feel like an attack on enthusiasts, I'm merely looking to help increase my own chances of success in the industry as well as gain some insight into what sets games apart to players.

My bro and I are Memoir fans and so I set about puting together a laser cut insert for the box. There are separate boxes for all the various pieces, each with their own engraving on the outside for organizing. There's also a spacer for the board and to keep the pieces in their boxes. 

Version 2 is forthcoming, with tape on the back to reduce burn marks and a better stain (non-oil based stain) that won't wreck the inside of the box. 

Tape was also added to the box because the boxes add weight. 

And I also tried using acrylic for the spacer, and I like how it turned out. 

Is anyone interested in the plans in DXF format?  If there's interest I can cut and sell unassembled kits (not looking to make a big profit here, only help those who don't have access to a laser cutter).

639,,boardgames,"Okay, a few years ago I played this game at a party and really liked it, now I don't remember the name of it.

&amp;#x200B;

It was turn-based. We had four players but I think you can do 3-6. Each player started with a hand of cards, maybe 5 or 6. There was a mat/board where cards could be discarded/staged. I believe the object of the game was to run out of cards, but I might be wrong. It had a medieval/magic/pastoral type theme. Different cards had different values/abilities and could affect the other players, like causing them to lose a turn or pick up additional cards from the deck, kind of like UNO, but it was more strategic than that.  There wasn't combat per se, but I seem to recall that certain character cards had advantages over others in certain scenarios.

&amp;#x200B;

I would describe it as a cross between Risk and UNO, with some Magic thrown in for good measure.

&amp;#x200B;

Any idea what I'm talking about? If I had to guess, this game came out in the last 10-15 years. I have looked all over Amazon and my local game store.  Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I remembered some more details about the gameplay. At the beginning of each player's turn, you get to decide what card(s) to use, I don't recall any dice but there is an element where each card has a certain value (say 3 or 5) and you can use up to a maximum value (say 10) on any turn with any combination of cards. Again, I think the object of the game is discard your entire hand.

EDIT! I'm pretty sure it's **Dominion**, but I'm not sure what edition.

Actually, I'm positive, it was Dominion. Thanks all for the help!

Tichu, Take That!, 6 Nimit, The Game, No Thanks!,  type games come to mind... some of them have other symbols to simulate die rolls, dominoes, all sorts of things... but some of those look a bit convoluted to me.

Here's a few links in case you don't know what I'm referring to (or if I'm just explaining it terribly):

[Rainbow Deck](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/59655/rainbow-deck)[Games that can be played with a Rainbow Deck](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/47512/games-can-be-played-rainbow-deck-cardgame-system)

[Rage Deck](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/568/rage)[Games that can be played with a Rage deck](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/1907/games-playable-rage-deck-not-ccg-please-add)  (Rage is an actual game, but evidently some people buy it to use it as a multifunction deck)

[Games that can be played with a Decktet](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/181466/games-ported-decktet)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure there's other systems as well....

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my questions for those with experience with them:

&amp;#x200B;

Do you enjoy playing games with them?  Or does it ""feel"" like you're just playing a prototype? (Especially if you're having to proxy cards that don't just have numbers... like if you said, ""ok, every Knave card is a ""draw 2 cards card"")

If there's extra symbols on the card, does it become overwhelming or distracting?

&amp;#x200B;

Morally, do you feel it's ""wrong"" to get these if it's going to replace (possibly) buying other games?

&amp;#x200B;

Which is your favorite deck and why?  Is it the one that plays the most games, or the one with the cleanest looking cards?

&amp;#x200B;

It appears that many of these you can't buy... you have to go to various printing sources and have them printed... how hard is that process?   Are you happy with the results?

Are these things just good for travel, or do you play regularly with them?

&amp;#x200B;

Any other thoughts and/or links would be welcome... just considering one of these for travel (and to possibly play some of the simpler filler type games mentioned above at home as well)",t2_dv6jm,False,,0,False,"What are your thoughts on multi-use decks?

I was reading the new meeple like us teardown when I noticed there's a new thing on their site.  It's a link to a [code of conduct](https://meeplelikeus.co.uk/code-of-ethics-1-0/). It goes over everything that the site promises to its readers and it's brilliant.   

I think it's new but it got me thinking.   There's been a lot of argument about ethics recently.  The guy from paradise posted a video saying it's okay to take money for reviews.   Watch it played did a different thing about paid reviews.    Men versus meeple seem to come up a lot.   They all do things in different ways and you need to really do your homework to find out what any of them think is okay and isn't.

So why aren't more sites just telling us how they work?

Whenever people talk about this a lot of people say ""as long as I know what's going on, I don't care"".   I don't know though how most sites actually work.   They don't make it easy to find out.   Lots get really offended if you even ask.

So why don't more sites just tell us what they think is okay and isn't?  It seems like such an easy solution.   If more sites did something like this it would be a good step towards at least a bit of transparency.  They can lie ofc but at least we'd know what they were lying about.

&amp;#x200B;

I spent the last few days reorganizing and straightening out the collection and wanted to share. I finally got almost everything horizontal and fitting about as well as it can. Even after a big cull a few months ago, there’s just barely enough room to hold it all. Don’t mind the décor. It’s basically Nerd Halloween here every day.

**How long have you been involved in the hobby?**

I learned about new wave board games with Power Grid in about 2005, but didn’t really start collecting until 2011. Back then I’d go to three or four regular games nights a week. Lately, as the groups have gotten older and more dispersed, I’ve had to start hosting my own once or twice a month.

**What would you change about your collection if you could?**

I’ve reached the point where any game coming in will probably cause another one to leave. As you can see, there’s room for maybe 6 more. I wish I had a dedicated game room so people wouldn’t have to try to fit in the teeny dining room and bits of the living room.

**Prized possession?**

The Glory To Rome black box would hurt the most to lose. I almost did once. My car was stolen with a box of games in the trunk. Back then the Amazon price for Glory was about $150 and my insurance paid that amount. By some miracle, the car was found about three months later and the games were still in the trunk. I got the game back and got to keep the money. It also had Cash n' Guns in there when it was going for $200.

**What games might be leaving your collection soon?**

Definitely Sentinels of the Multiverse. I backed a couple of their Kickstarters because I love the idea of the game, but in practice I just don’t ever get it to the table. Probably some others, too, but I’ll have to think about it.

**Not Pictured?**

There’s Bargain Quest and Artemis Project coming in. They’re the first I’ve Kickstarted in a couple years and I’m looking forward to them. Behind the couch there’s games I’ll probably not play, but don’t want to get rid of like my childhood Star Wars Monopoly, some Harry Potter games.

705,,boardgames,"This is a story of a game night I joined that is part rant but also advice for us here that *love* boardgames and find ourselves in a charged state while teaching others the wonders of our favorite games.

---

So I joined a different gaming group for the first time. There were about 8 people chatting and waiting for 7 PM to roll around. This group meets for range of game types. Walking in I saw games like **Imperial**, **Imperial Settlers**, **Sushi Go Party**, **Manhattan Project**, **Chinatown**, **Power Grid**, and **Endeavor**.

I have always wanted to try **Imperial Settlers**, so I joined with a girl, *J*, who has also never played and I believe the owner of the copy...let's call him *El*. So El breaks out all components and is explaining the empires, the expansions present, and which ones he recommended we start with. Cool. I don't know the game so I'm not picky about my empire. J got Barbarians, I got Egypt (not exactly for beginners) and he chose Japan.

We begin the teach. It isn't very organized and he is explaining *how* to play the game at a pretty brisk pace. Swords and stones and wood and razing and foundations and deals and actions and production...*UGH*. A few minutes in I ask, ""So what are we going for here?,"" asking really for our **purpose**. He stops, looks at me with impatient confusion and says, ""You're trying to get points. You're trying to get the most VP.""

""Well yeah,"" I reply. ""I see we are going for VP. I mean what is our purpose here? What are we trying to do?""

""You're trying to build a empire by building structures with resources that give you bonuses throughout the game,"" he forces out.

""Oohhhh!"" J and I let out in unison. The swords and stones and foundations all made much more sense! We continue on with the teach following along with considerable more ease.

It's time to complete setup. El's hands are sweeping across the table, grabbing our starting resources and placing them on our boards. J and I being new, we weren't quite sure why we got different starting resources. It had to be explained to us again. OK moving on. J is first player, chosen by that pretty neat app on El's phone that detects everyone's finger pressed on the screen and randomly chooses FP. 

Time to draft cards (the *Lookout Phase*). El lays out the four (3P+1) cards in front of us. Before J, the first player, can absorb what has been placed in front of her, El calls out the optimal card and suggests she takes that one. She pauses to read the other cards, but ends up choosing El's suggestion. El shifts the cards to me and calls out the next optimal card. ""You should take this one,"" and explains why it is the best option. El's brusque disposition was really starting to show here, most surely elevated from his fiery ardor for boardgames.

""Hold on a second, man. Let me see what's going on here,"" I leveled. I wanted to read these damn cards and learn what types of options we would be presented with during the game. As a learner, it's important to learn what is out there as much as it is to identify ""optimal"" cards. We draft cards in the opposite order, again experiencing El's declarations of the best cards for us before we could read and understand any of the cards placed in front of us. OK, here we go. Let's just play this game and have a good time.

The game gets going. Not long into it, I notice another antic of El's. His lower jaw is down and jutting out, chest rising and falling as air rushed into and out of his mouth, eyes piercing his cards as he studies them. The only thing missing was a caption hanging below his head: *[Heavy breathing intensifies]*. This dude *loves* this game. As J and I place cards down, El's eyes get locked on our cards as they are laid. He identifies the cards the instant he sees the front, and is again declaring to us what they mean, what we get, even which side to place the cards, and as I slide the card into place, all my resources earned have already been placed in my tableau.

The game goes on like this. El is moving our resources around, taking what we intend to spend and grabbing what we intend to take. His hands are in our tableau as much as he is spending in his. A few times I had to motion my hands in an attempt to slow him down and allow me to *think* through my own damn options. I didn't score as well as they did come game end. I owe part of that due to refusing to play his suggestions out of my own frustration from his intrusive ""facilitation"" of the game. I didn't have that great of a time and I likely will avoid his table from this point on.

So to my boardgame community I say, it's fine if your heart rate climbs when you hear that cardboard fart when opening up your favorite game. It is certainly a good thing to show the world all the awesome games it has never played. But fuck me, if you want them to have a good time and you want to ensure they know *how*--and want--to play the game next time around, get your damn hands off their tokens and game pieces, know when to bite your tongue and let them think--and act--for themselves (unless they are struggling or ask), and *let. them. fucking. play.*

Funny enough, I vented to my partner and he immediately reminded me of how he had to tell me in the past not to place my hands in any way on his side of the table due to pretty much the same reasons. So I am guilty too, but I'm more woke now following that game night. I will make every effort to allow newbies to a game their own physical and mental space for maximum enjoyment. Thanks for reading.

**Edit:** I'll acknowledge the personal element here and say that it isn't necessary for my testimony. I'll leave it in here for readers' reference but I will admit it wasn't necessary to convey my main message. I was trying to paint a picture, and I chose the wrong way to do it. El, you showed up in this thread. I apologize for the personal attack, but my message still stands. I don't think that should change now that you saw this post. Like I said, a lot of us are guilty in letting our excitement get the best of us, and it may become overbearing to others when we forget to slow down and let new players truly experience the game. I, particularly, enjoy the try-fail-experiment-succeed element of learning a game. I don't want to know the best move, I want to learn my way there. I think some here will identify with that. It just wasn't a good pairing of teacher-learner styles and thought I'd offer to the community, by example, a teaching style that is adverse to the learners' experience.",t2_4qb7c,False,,0,False,"Give a man a meeple and he plays for a day...

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I joined a different gaming group for the first time. There were about 8 people chatting and waiting for 7 PM to roll around. This group meets for range of game types. Walking in I saw games like &lt;strong&gt;Imperial&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Imperial Settlers&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Sushi Go Party&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Manhattan Project&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Chinatown&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Power Grid&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Endeavor&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always wanted to try &lt;strong&gt;Imperial Settlers&lt;/strong&gt;, so I joined with a girl, &lt;em&gt;J&lt;/em&gt;, who has also never played and I believe the owner of the copy...let&amp;#39;s call him &lt;em&gt;El&lt;/em&gt;. So El breaks out all components and is explaining the empires, the expansions present, and which ones he recommended we start with. Cool. I don&amp;#39;t know the game so I&amp;#39;m not picky about my empire. J got Barbarians, I got Egypt (not exactly for beginners) and he chose Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We begin the teach. It isn&amp;#39;t very organized and he is explaining &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to play the game at a pretty brisk pace. Swords and stones and wood and razing and foundations and deals and actions and production...&lt;em&gt;UGH&lt;/em&gt;. A few minutes in I ask, &amp;quot;So what are we going for here?,&amp;quot; asking really for our &lt;strong&gt;purpose&lt;/strong&gt;. He stops, looks at me with impatient confusion and says, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re trying to get points. You&amp;#39;re trying to get the most VP.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well yeah,&amp;quot; I reply. &amp;quot;I see we are going for VP. I mean what is our purpose here? What are we trying to do?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re trying to build a empire by building structures with resources that give you bonuses throughout the game,&amp;quot; he forces out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oohhhh!&amp;quot; J and I let out in unison. The swords and stones and foundations all made much more sense! We continue on with the teach following along with considerable more ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s time to complete setup. El&amp;#39;s hands are sweeping across the table, grabbing our starting resources and placing them on our boards.

713,,boardgames,"As I'm reading about Feld's latest game, [Revolution of 1828](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/265260/revolution-1828), I thought about ranking my favourite 10 games that he designed. His trademark games comprise multiple yet simple scoring systems ('point salads' to some), but the games revolve around mechanisms that limit the available options on any player's given turn. Therefore, players focus on action manipulation and managing flexibility. Anyway, here is my list. I know a few highly rated titles did not make it. Happy to see your list!

\#10. **Aquasphere** \- an interesting mix of rondel and delayed action selection. It's one of the more cutthroat Feld games as there is area control scoring and you can bump other players' pieces back to reduce their scoring opportunity.

\#9. **Macao** \- a simple yet brilliant design. Select coloured dice with pip value N, giving you N cubes of that colour N rounds from now. Any unused cubes on a round are lost. Would have been a higher place if the scoring is more exciting and the rulebook is better written.

\#8. **Carpe Diem -** the latest design on this list. The gameplay is simple, place a tile from a central market onto your board to earn bonuses and end game points for completed features. The round-to-round scoring is interesting: every round you must fulfil two adjacent scoring objectives on a randomised grid. Failing to do so results in losing points. It's a game about managing flexibility.  

\#7. **Notre Dame -** A card drafting game in which everyone starts with the same deck so you have a bit of control over what your neighbours can do. It's very smooth and the expansion added more variability.

\#6. **Bora Bora** \- a worker placement using dice. Higher number offers more powerful actions but a lower number blocks out a worker placement spot for any comparatively higher numbers. Very tight and sometimes brutal.

\#5. **Trajan -** Move cogs clockwise around a mancala and do the action corresponding to the final place you drop off a cog. It rewards planning ahead your next 5+ moves. Used to be higher on the list but perhaps I've played it too many times. 

\#4. **The Speicherstadt**  / Jorvik - The game of queuing. Queue up to buy a card, where the price equals the number of people in that queue.  Queue earlier for a better chance of getting what you want (sometimes at a steep price) and queue later to spite your opponents (or maybe end up get something cheap!). One of the most interactive Feld games and the length hits a sweet spot.

\#3. **Luna -** a perfect information game. This is about positioning your workers at the right place at the right time. A brilliant mix of short term tactics and long term strategy.

\#2. **Bruges -** a game of multi-use cards. Highly replayable especially with the expansion. Satisfying when you pull off combos or outwit your opponents on one of the majority scoring.

\#1. **Castles of Burgundy -** no surprises here. Very satisfactory to plan ahead and set off chain reactions.",t2_7aok5,False,,0,False,Here's my top 10 games by Stefan Feld.

716,,boardgames,"**Edit**: Solved!

Okay bear with me. I've only played it once and it was several months ago so my details are fuzzy and possible not entirely accurate.

&amp;#x200B;

I played it in February of this year (2019) and I'm going to say it was likely fairly recently released but don't bank on that, it could be years old, I'm not sure.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, all the details below are the best I can remember but may not be accurate at all so if you come up with a game that matches most things but not at all with a detail or two, post it because I may be wrong.

* It's a big board with several different areas/actions to do.
* I believe it's maybe ancient or medieval time themed.
* I think??? there's also a ship off the board where you can send stuff off for points or currency.
* You get 2 actions per turn and other players cannot do the same actions you do. (maybe 2 people can do each action? maybe a worker placement, but I don't think so).
* The middle of the board play area/action is steps you have to climb (2D, so really just move forward on) and you're trying to make it to the top each round to like maybe pay respect to the emperor/king so you can score each round. This part is very important because everyone each round has to make it to a certain point in this area or they don't get points or something bad happens.
* In one of the corners (bottom right?) there's a windy track players move along and this track is used for tie breaking during the game. There are many times where tie breaking is needed and the person furthest along on this track wins the ties. There are 2 checkpoints on this track (green gems) and you move forward and backward because you use something.
* Green(??) gems are like rare or important or something (I don't think there are other color gems, just this one gem).
* In another area you can hire people/abilities which are represented by small square (maybe 1in x 1in) cardboard. One of the people/abilities gives you a permanent discount for the game, 1 gives you more points, etc... You can hire multiple people / get multiple special things but I think there were only 2 of each special thing so there was a bit of a race to get these. They were pretty expensive though so you had to build up some kind of currency a bit first.

I think that's about all I have. I brought this up at game night last night and nobody could think of it  (thanks to my terrible recollection) so I don't have high hopes but figured I'd try here.

723,,boardgames,"*This is my first attempt at reviewing boardgames and at writing for a blog. I'd really like to hear what people think of it, and if there's an audience for these kind of themed collated micro reviews:*

&amp;#x200B;

As tabletop gaming has started to gain newfound traction, with fans flocking to Kickstarter to express their support, the want for ‘more stuff’ is increasing in demand. Gloomhaven, for example, rose to the highest rank of BoardGameGeek by fulfilling the promise of a dungeon-crawling campaign that could take literally years to complete.

Smaller, bitesize cardboard experiences may not be quite as complex or immersive as their expansive big-boy-box counterparts, but there are some that manage to be incredibly rewarding, without requiring you to sacrifice an entire evening for the pleasure.

In the first of this series of collated board game micro-reviews, I want to look at a few games both big and small that attempt to strike a delicate balance between content and engagement, for those who want to be as efficient as possible with their tabletop time.

&amp;#x200B;

**BIG - Star Wars: Rebellion**

Never trust a board game by its suggested playtime. I have failed to heed my own advice too many times when bringing this game to the table. 2-4 hours seems like all the time this cat-and-mouse race through space should need, what could possibly go wrong? 

One player or team of two takes command of the massively overpowered Empire, attempting to locate and blow up the Rebel Base, controlled by the Rebels, who are simply trying to survive. There’s a set amount of rounds in the game, which the Rebels can reduce by completing special objectives, but there’s such a variety of cool-sounding things to do every round that it can take an exceedingly long time to plan and execute. 

While the thinking-phase of the game can vary in length depending on player experience, the combat is a persistent drag. Despite being logistically simple, the sheer amount of fiddliness with tokens and identifying damage done based on the colour of the die rolled means that it frequently brings the game to a grinding halt. That said, the asymmetric design of the game is relatively flawless: the Rebels have weaker forces but are able to constantly undermine the Empire, who struggle to pin them down despite their strength in numbers. This tension aptly matches the tone of the conflict in the Star Wars universe.

Verdict: Rebellion is relatively easy to pick up and play, but the brainpower required to outwit your opponent can too often result in epics that take longer to resolve than a trilogy of films. For everything there is to love about the vast majority of the experience, it can’t help but feel like a slog by the end. The combat definitely doesn’t help.

&amp;#x200B;

**SMALL - Love Letter**

Like the early seasons of Game of Thrones, this isn’t about thrilling battles, epic dragons, and illogical plot developments - this is about sordid romantic conspiracies and tactical masterminds deceiving their allies to distract from what’s hidden up their sleeve.

As a player you attempt to unveil and eliminate all other possible suitors of a princess until one lover is left standing, or by ending a round with the closest connection to the princess (a.k.a holding the highest number card). You only have two cards available to use on your turn, each with a number value and a special effect that can either help or hinder.

The challenge of this game is avoiding letting others learn the contents of your hand, as that is the easiest way to secure a rival’s elimination. There are no opportunities for temporary allegiances, meaning no one can be trusted at any time. Instead, this game allows you to expose how your friends behave when smuggling the truth under pressure.

Verdict: This game has been tough to recommend to friends, despite it’s 5-15 minute playtime, because the rules don’t seem as easy as other compact experiences. But whenever I can convince a group to give it a go, it’s great for testing your mates’ poker faces, and fun for anyone who enjoys some simple sexy subterfuge.

&amp;#x200B;

**BIG - Gloomhaven**

This is a mammoth game that succeeds at taking players on a sprawling campaign featuring a unique and engaging selection of playable classes, varied yet easy-to-learn mechanics, and inventive ways of repurposing a vast core set of components. There are so many boards, props, minions, etc, that the game can be a challenge to setup and initially organise, but these many different parts ensure that no two games are the same.

You are part of a Guild trying to survive in the city of Gloomhaven and the surrounding wilds. Over the course of 100 or so missions (with objectives such as ‘kill all monsters on the board’ or ‘escort the NPC from one corner of the board to another), players create and retire several characters as they follow a non-linear story in a world that gradually reveals itself. This is the closest thing to D’n’D in a box, without the need for a GM.

The overarching player/character development feels like a video game as you upgrade abilities, make moral choices, and find more loot, while the main gameplay is a cross between cooperative card gaming and strategic turn-based combat. This is all confined to scenarios that individually won’t take more than an hour or two to complete, without requiring much commitment from occasional players. The story isn’t going to win any awards, but it is satisfyingly fun context for any guild of adventurers.

Verdict: I have invested more time into this game than any other, with more than half of the content remaining locked to me. If you can find a way to ease the process of setup, this is a game that you will want to bring back to the table to continue your adventures, with a flexibility of playtime that can last an entire day or just a couple of hours.

&amp;#x200B;

**SMALL - Exploding Kittens**

Another Kickstarter success story, this game is about as brief as a game of Russian Roulette, and just as intense... well, almost. Exploding Kittens is about luck, screwing other people over, and avoiding the ever-present threat of sudden death by fiery feline.

In the Oatmeal’s tabletop debut, you either win or you die. On a turn, you play as many cards as you wish before ending your go by drawing a card. If that card happens to be an Exploding Kitten, you’re out of the game unless you have the means to defuse it.

A simple concept that carves out easy conflict between you and your competitors as everyone tries to avoid drawing cards, especially if all players suspect that a recently defused kitten might have been returned to the top of the deck by a near-‘sploded player.

Verdict: This is the preferred choice by most of my friends as the easiest game to get out for a quick game or several. It’s a refreshing outlet for friends to take turns at attacking one another while trying to turn the increasingly unlikely odds in their favour.

&amp;#x200B;

**BIG - Batman: Gotham City Chronicles**

This game and its jam-packed expansions can easily total a small fortune for anyone who wants to invest in the full collection. It’s incredibly immersive and wonderfully detailed for any DC fan, but that comes at the cost of time-consuming complexity. Surely this is the perfect case in point for my argument - that perhaps less is more and we need to refrain from buying into these deliciously complex collections of combat-ready figurines.

In a single game, one player takes the mantle of the villains, while the others each pick a hero and proceed to complete specific objectives. All of the characters and scenarios have their own features and contextual effects, to create an excessively detailed world for friends to showdown within. It really is a smorgasbord of delights for any dark knight fan.

Considering how many rules apply to the vast array of playable characters and scenarios available in the base game alone, it’s hard to say whether it would take longer to learn the game than the estimated 4 hours required to play a scenario. Not to mention that each playable character requires learning an relatively unique skill set prior to each game and, unlike Gloomhaven, these missions don’t contribute to a grander narrative.

Then again... this is the only streamlined Batman tabletop experience outside of the even more elaborate Batman Miniatures Game. For some, that alone might be worth it.

Verdict: I don’t know if I can recommend it. But I know that I want it.

&amp;#x200B;

**SMALL - Munchkin**

Munchkin offers a deluxe edition with a board that serves as a basic visual guide, but really this is a compact tabletop card game that proves you don’t need endless pieces of plastic for an adequate adventure with satisfying competition and character development.

Your goal is to reach level 10. To gain a level, you must defeat a monster. The game encourages strategy and conversation by giving you the option to work with or against each other. Players can either assist you in combat, in exchange for a share of the rewards, or they might side with the monsters to make life even harder for you

This game manages to maintain the depth of a classic dungeon crawler and strip out all the faff thanks to its reliance on a simple card-based system to create a variety of quick encounters and with rewards that progress your character. The experience is designed to give players a taste of what pen-and-paper RPGs consist of, in only a fraction of the time.

Verdict: A perfectly compact excerpt of what players desire from classic RPGs without unnecessary role-playing and fiddliness, which can be started and wrapped up within the same hour, or played on repeat for a satisfying full evening of dungeoneering.

&amp;#x200B;

**IN CONCLUSION (the long and short of it)**

There are stark differences between long hefty tabletop experiences and their condensed counterparts, as well as the types of audiences they specifically appeal to. Games that last several hours are typically tests of endurance and brainpower, testing players logistical ability to evolve their strategies based on the way the opponent is developing. Despite the draw of these exhaustive games to experienced players, the games that stand the test of time and get brought back to the table are those that respect your time, allow you to improve your skills, and provide unique experiences with each new game.

Whereas the games that last several hours absolutely require that you are with a group of people that are equally as committed to playing as you are, shorter games are great for playing with people you want to know better, or want to gauge the interest of before proposing an 8 hour Twilight Imperium Campaign. The best of these will expose something about the deeper personalities of the people around you in a microcosm, with the real challenge being how you read other players rather than rebut their actions. They are often perfect ice breakers or time-fillers for social occasions with friends and strangers alike, rather than being the sole focus of an entire evening (or longer).

Not to mention that each playable character requires learning an relatively unique skill set prior to each game and, unlike Gloomhaven, these missions don’t contribute to a grander narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then again... this is the only streamlined Batman tabletop experience outside of the even more elaborate Batman Miniatures Game. For some, that alone might be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdict: I don’t know if I can recommend it. But I know that I want it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SMALL - Munchkin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Munchkin offers a deluxe edition with a board that serves as a basic visual guide, but really this is a compact tabletop card game that proves you don’t need endless pieces of plastic for an adequate adventure with satisfying competition and character development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your goal is to reach level 10. To gain a level, you must defeat a monster. The game encourages strategy and conversation by giving you the option to work with or against each other. Players can either assist you in combat, in exchange for a share of the rewards, or they might side with the monsters to make life even harder for you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game manages to maintain the depth of a classic dungeon crawler and strip out all the faff thanks to its reliance on a simple card-based system to create a variety of quick encounters and with rewards that progress your character. The experience is designed to give players a taste of what pen-and-paper RPGs consist of, in only a fraction of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdict: A perfectly compact excerpt of what players desire from classic RPGs without unnecessary role-playing and fiddliness, which can be started and wrapped up within the same hour, or played on repeat for a satisfying full evening of dungeoneering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN CONCLUSION (the long and short of it)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are stark differences between long hefty tabletop experiences and their condensed counterparts, as well as the types of audiences they specifically appeal to. Games that last several hours are typically tests of endurance and brainpower, testing players logistical ability to evolve their strategies based on the way the opponent is developing. Despite the draw of these exhaustive games to experienced players, the games that stand the test of time and get brought back to the table are those that respect your time, allow you to improve your skills, and provide unique experiences with each new game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas the games that last several hours absolutely require that you are with a group of people that are equally as committed to playing as you are, shorter games are great for playing with people you want to know better, or want to gauge the interest of before proposing an 8 hour Twilight Imperium Campaign. The best of these will expose something about the deeper personalities of the people around you in a microcosm, with the real challenge being how you read other players rather than rebut their actions. They are often perfect ice breakers or time-fillers for social occasions with friends and strangers alike, rather than being the sole focus of an entire evening (or longer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

727,,boardgames,"Hey, i am just starting to build a small collection of board games and looking for some great games.  


**Introduction:**

I am looking for games that you can learn quick and play right away even with new players.  
But at the same time having played many PC games with a lot of complexity  
(Strategy like Civilizations, ARPGs like Diablo II and Path of Exile and games like Factorio).  
So i also love complex game mechanics.  


I started about 2-3 weeks ago looking for something one could play when we have guests.  
First thing i bought is Machi Koro which checks al the marks we were looking for.  
Easy to teach, quick to start and beginners don't get destroyed by experienced players.  
Only negative thing is that sometimes you get so many buildings that you need a lot of space on the table.

&amp;#x200B;

Then just recently i bought Carcassonne which i think can be perfect because it's still easy to teach and you can start quick enough while it has more complexity which i like. Gonna test it on the weekend.  


For the future I also put Terra Mystica and Spirit Island on my list fore more complex games that can be played when we have more time and look for something more challenging.  


**Kingdomino:**  
Now that you know a little about our background, I found out about Kingdomino just recently and thought about adding it to the collection of games that can be quickly explained and started with guests.  
But we want to be able to also play games when we are more then 4.  


So we were wondering if we should get 2x Kingdomino or 1x Kingdomino and 1x Queendomino.  


I read that many don't like Queendomino because it takes away the simplicity of Kingdomino.  
But i myself like it a little more complex and was wondering if it would be so much more difficult to teach it to new players.

&amp;#x200B;

If we go for 2x Kingdomino i'm afraight that it could get boring too quick.  
But when we get 1 King and 1 Queen i was wondering if it would become to complicated to quickly start with new players.  


Though i guess that if we'd start with King + Queen with more then 4 players, we could play 1 round without the queen rules to introduce them to the base mechanics and then add the queen rules. The first round the red tiles would be completely useless but i think for the purpose of teaching that would be fine.

&lt;p&gt;This is meant to be a place where you can ask any and all questions relating to the board gaming world: general or specific game recommendations, rule clarifications, definitions of terms/acronyms, and other quick questions that might not warrant their own post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are seeking game recommendations you will get better responses if you give us enough background to help you. You can use &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template-no-explainer""&gt;this template&lt;/a&gt; to do so. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a version with explanations of what we&amp;#39;re looking for.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you reply to any comment that has a game name in &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt; with &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/r2d8""&gt;/u/r2d8&lt;/a&gt; getparentinfo&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, one of our robots will tell you more about the game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember that this is a community full of awesome, helpful people, and feel free to ask your questions whatever they may be. As always, keep it civil and remember what the downvote button is actually for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, here are some of the resources available at &lt;a href=""/r/boardgames""&gt;/r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

734,,boardgames,"**Another great title in the series of Fast Forward games**

This is the fourth title in the ""Fast Forward"" series of games from Friedemann Friese, so if you've already played two other titles in that series (FEAR and FORTRESS), then [**Fast Forward FORTUNE**](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/2218050) will definitely give you a sense of the familiar.  Like FORTRESS, FORTUNE requires you to get specific combinations of cards.  And like FEAR, it requires you to compare hands when something is triggered. But it's the combination of these elements that makes FORTUNE feel new.

Once again the ""fable system"" of this game means that you learn how to play it on the fly, with special cards explaining the rules.  Much of the fun is about discovering how the game ebbs and flows as new rules get added, and the trajectory of the game-play keeps altering.  The gameplay is very easy for first-timers to follow, especially the basic concept of collecting the best three card hand to win. But then the game ramps up with some interesting scoring elements that are borrowed from games like Blackjack, or tinker with the scoring in other ways.

The theme of FORTUNE is related to the spinning wheels of a casino slot machine.  The actual game-play fits with the ""fortune"" theme very well, because it creates a light and frenzied feel that does bring to mind the slots.  You do have objectives to aim for, but because these can suddenly change, you are being bounced around in an entertaining ride.

**Recommendation:** If you have already tried the other titles in the Fast Forward series, but found them not to be your cup of tea, then Fast Forward FORTUNE won't convince you otherwise, because it's more or less in the mould of some of the other games in this series.  But if you already enjoyed FEAR and FORTRESS, you're almost certain to like this one as well. And if you haven't played any of the series at all, this is as good a place to start as with any of the others.  Even for those who aren't big fans of these games will admit that the game design here is truly unique.  If you're a gamer, you owe it to yourself to at least try one title in this series, to see what the fuss is all about, and FORTUNE is as good a choice as any of them.

736,,boardgames,"**TL;DR bit of a rant about snobbery in boardgaming, and looking down on people who enjoy or even deliberately prefer ""gateway"" or ""party"" games for whatever reason.**

This is something that I see in many places and in many texts on the subject, and it's been bugging me for a while, so apologies if it's already been covered to death elsewhere (but please provide me a link as I'd love to follow any other discussions on the subject).

Now, I'm not a new gamer by any means, but neither am I a super dedicated one. Life has moved on and these days I'm in my late 30s, I have a family with young kids, and pets, and a demanding job, and plenty of other hobbies that don't involve gaming in any manner whatsoever. This means that the D&amp;D all-nighters of my youth are gone, and I simply don't have the time or budget to invest in lengthy, complex games that take hours for a single session.

This means that things in categories like ""party games"" and ""gateway games"" are perfect for me. They don't cost the earth or eat up all of my free time. I can teach them to newer gamers quite easily, in some cases play with my older kids, and for my more experienced gamer friends they represent a way to fit several games into an otherwise relatively short game night.

As an example of what prompted me to write this post, sometimes I come across comments like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c5u0ny/be_nice_to_new_gamers_please_dont_yuck_the_yum_of/) in a recent discussion:

&gt;I overheard another customer be mocked by their friend and an employee for buying a party game. He was met with comments like ""Oh, he's new to gaming"" and ""he'll get there.""

Okay, that's a horrible unFLGS, because you don't have to be new or inexperienced to enjoy a party game, and I think we can all agree on the wrongness of this behaviour. But the OP there also continued to say:

&gt;Please stop doing this to our new folk. Everyone is new to gaming at some point. It can be fun to explore new and increasingly more complex games. It can also be fun to whip out Exploding Kittens and Coup. A lot of these serve as gateway games that get people more involved.

The message is well-meant. But while he was attacking the awful behaviour of the people at the game store, he was also reinforcing the existing bias that *party games and gateway games are only for people who are new and learning about gaming*, and even the term ""gateway game"" itself suggests that it's an intermediate step, before you get into ""real"" games.

I understand the history of the term and it is generally the case that these are lower-complexity games that really do serve this purpose, but what bugs me is the implication that you *ought to* move on from such games and onto ""proper"" games, only bringing them out again for newbies or at parties. I'm sure many ""real"" gamers would frown at my collection of mostly gateway and party games, and tell me haughtily that I'm not a real gamer because I don't have anything that can't be played in under three hours.

But you know what? I like these games. I don't play them to prove some point to myself, or my friends, or to show how advanced I am as a gamer. I play the games that I play because they are fun, and they are social, and they don't eat into time I don't have. And I don't see them as in any way inferior. Sure, I'm no stranger to things like *Twilight Struggle* and I'd play longer and more complex games if I had the time - but even if I did, I don't always want that. So can we all get off our collective high horses about gateway games and party games and just accept that they are as good as any other game?

743,,boardgames,"I remember the excitement, when I unwrapped the extremely heavy box on my birthday, that I had upon seeing that my wife had gotten me **Near and Far** for me. I had heard many great reviews of this game, praising the art and the story, and we couldn't wait to get a game of it in. 

We started the tutorial and had a blast. And the reviewers weren't kidding about the art. It was a visual feast, with interestingly drawn characters, beautiful maps, a huge book of quests, with choices to make. It was an absolute blast. We decided right then and there, that instead of Pandemic Legacy Season One, we were going to play this campaign instead.

And now, since we finished it last night, I can't help but say that I'm disappointed. After a few plays, you've seen literally everything the game has to offer mechanically. You have few interesting gameplay choices, as you're routed through a routine again and again that can have some variation, but nothing that is really that interesting mechanically. 

But that's ok right? This game has amazing art and is all about the story right? And it does have some interesting lore, pulling off some very cool world-building. You'll be introduced to characters who keep popping up, make interesting quest decisions, and be ever further driven towards the final goal of reaching the last map in the campaign, the Lost Ruins.

And none of it really matters. Sadly, all the quests feel like MMO sidequests, with little depth beyond making a choice for positive rep and rewards or negative rep and rewards. You'll be introduced to big bads, who are built up over multiple games, finally confronting them.....only to find out they are weaker than the toughest opponents in the game, barely get a paragraph to wrap up their ""story"" and then do quests that talk about them as if they are still around.

Indeed, people will plead with you to perform some tasks that don't happen, indeed, nothing of interest happens, there is no special end of campaign wrap up, nothing that ties up the campaign and finishes the story. You've just won or lost yet another game that basically played like all the others, except you could fight a boss (again, who is weaker than the toughest one you can normally encounter) and gain some VP.

As some people might have noticed in my posts in the ""What did you play last week"" - the game had been grating on me since about halfway through the campaign (10 games, not counting the tutorial). Honestly, we probably only kept whacking at it due to sunk cost fallacy. We thought, perhaps foolishly, at the the final map would be epic. 

It was just more of the same, and that samey-ness is in all aspects of the game. If there were more quest chains (easily the best parts of the game), an epic finale, or quite simply ""more"" to the game, I think it could have been so great.

I do want to state that we have not played any of the character games (in them, instead of doing quests based off of the map, you run through a set number of quests that deal specifically with your character) and perhaps those would have been better. I don't know, but maybe we'll eventually give them a try, maybe in a while. I will give them props, they give you plenty of variety of ways to play the game, but it'll be a bit before we'll see if they are worth trying.

[Part 5 (Final) - Iterate, Iterate, Iterate](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/cakhsi/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_5_final_iterate_iterate/)

Hey all. I’m back with another semi-weekly article on the journey of creating a home-brew Spirit. After coming up with an idea for a Spirit, I had to do additional research in order to make sure that the idea fit thematically.

**Thematic Research**

I started with a simple google search. Something along the lines of “phenomenon found in deserts” and went from there. From the list of resulting sites I made a list of ideas that could potentially be used to create a desert/antlion based Spirit:

* Oasis
* Mirage
* Haboob/Sandstorm
* Desert Heat
* Cactus
* Desert Varnish
* Flash Floods
* Quicksand

Then I decided to figure out the play style. My initial reaction was to embrace the antlion fantasy of gathering in Invaders and then destroying them. Both would most likely be Innate Powers. In order to facilitate that, I needed a Special Rule (or two) that would allow the theme to come through into the mechanical realm of the game.

So I settled on the following Special Rules:

1. Presence can only be placed in the Sands.
2. When Presence is placed, gather 1 Explorer or 1 Town or 1 Dahan into that same land.
   1. Note: The astute player will notice that there is definitely something wrong with this Special Rule, but we’ll get into that in a later article.

Then I decided to get a little weird and add one more that I thought might be interesting.

* Plant and Water Elements count as Sun instead.

I wanted the Spirit to be unique and play differently, and to me this last rule would help set it up to be different enough from the other Spirits because it would most likely contain high numbers of Sun Elements in its Innate Power Element thresholds. I was fascinated by the idea of having a Spirit whose final Innate Power Element threshold was something around the magnitude of 10 Sun Elements to trigger. A card that provided a Sun, Water, and Plant Symbol would instead generate 3 Sun Elements. You’ll see how this Special Rule fared in future articles.

So now that I had a basic idea of Special Rules and some ideas for Innate Powers, I went back to the thematic research and began crafting the Unique Power Cards. I took the same list and jotted down ideas for each thing:

* Oasis
   * Remove a blight
   * Gather Invaders
   * Gather Dahan
* Mirage
   * Fear
   * Gather Invaders
* Haboob/Sandstorm
   * Destroy Explorers
   * Destroy Towns
   * Fear
   * Push Explorers
   * Push Towns
   * Defend
   * Skip Actions
* Desert Heat
   * Deal damage with extra in Sands
* Cactus
   * Wilds tokens
   * Defend
* Desert Varnish
   * Defend
* Flash Floods
   * Ultimately decided against trying to describe this one since River had a Flash Flood card already.
* Quicksand
   * Defend
   * Wilds
   * Beasts
   * Destroy Explorers
   * Fear
* Singing Sand Dunes (Look it up, it’s pretty cool)
   * Gather Explorers
   * Fear

I did realize at a later date that Quicksand isn’t actually a desert thing (as portrayed in movies) since its composition requires a decent amount of water, which isn’t something that deserts are particularly rife with. Hindsight is 20/20, so I decided to go with it at the beginning since it seemed so versatile.

I’m a Computer Scientist by trade and I find that naming things is incredibly difficult sometimes. As such, I waffled all over the place trying to come up with a name for this Spirit. I really wanted it to have a name like Shifting Sands Consume the Lost, or Shifting Sands Devours the Doomed, but the alliterations were killing me. I threw around other weird names like Shifting Sand’s Black Blizzard, or even Desert As An All Consuming Void (blech). It was really hard. Then I finally settled on **Shifting Desert’s Gaping Maw**. It just felt right saying it and reading it on paper, so that’s what I went with. The name has grown on me since then and I don’t think I’ll change it.

Now with a name and some basic ideas of thematic elements I could use to bring the Spirit to life, I moved on to the next step, creating the first (very rough) draft.

Initial Ideas Chosen for Unique Power Cards:

* Bottomless Pits of Quicksand
   * 3 Cost, Fast, Range 1 from Sand, Any land
   * Defend 4
   * Destroy 1 Explorer
   * Add 1 Wilds
   * Elements: Water/Earth (Water = Sun)
* Scorch with Desert Heat
   * 2 Cost, Slow, Range 1 from Sand, Any land
   * 1 Damage
   * \+1 Damage if target land is Sand
   * Elements: Sun/Fire/Air
* Singing Dunes of Sand
   * 2 Cost, Slow, Range 1 from Sand, Any land
   * 2 Fear
   * Gather up to 2 Explorers
   * Elements: Earth/Sun
* Thrashing Walls of Sand
   * 2 Cost, Slow, Range 1 from Sand, Any land
   * Destroy 1 Explorer and 1 Town
   * Elements: Air/Sun

NOTE: Anyone who plays the game regularly will most likely find some things wrong with the above Power Cards just with a cursory glance.

Again, all names are WIP and most of them aren't even what I'm using now, it just goes to show how dynamic and changing the process was for me at the beginning.

This article will be limited to the draft of the Power Cards and some links on how to get your own templates to use for your own purposes.

Here's the [Power Card Template](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/180640/power-card-front-template-file) that I used as well as the [Spirit Panel Template](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/180025/spirit-panel-play-side-template-file). A huge shout out to BGG user Latzko and his amazing work in making these templates (as well as the others users that have contributed to the process).

Note: The files are in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic) format, so open it with whatever preferred software you have for it (Photoshop or something else). I downloaded Inkscape (and it's what was recommended in Latzko's post) and it has been a useful tool if you're not opposed to free open source applications.

The Power Card Template is pretty straightforward, you just need to download it and you're good to start using it after unzipping it from the archive. Just open it in Inkscape (or other program) and you can start working on it. A note, you will want to install the fonts that come in the zip archive to get what seems to be the closest font to what is officially used.

The Spirit Panel Template's directions aren't quite as obvious. I'll list out what each file is for and the format:

* Part 1 - Zip Archive that contains the SVG file, a README to help with explaining, and 4 font archives.
* Part 2 - It's a 002 Format, which isn't anything your computer will recognize. Just put it in the same place as the SVG file from Part 1
* Part 3 - It's a 003 Format, so do the same thing.
* Part 4 - It's a 004 Format, so do the same thing once more.

After that, with everything in the same folder, you're good to just open the SVG file in Inkscape and go from there. Latzko has provided a wonderful tutorial on the different aspects on the template and how to use it if you have questions.

So with that, I had made the (very) rough draft of the starting Unique Power Cards. In the next article I'll walk you through the process of creating the Spirit Board, including Growth option, Presence Tracks, Elemental thresholds, Innate Powers, and the reasoning behind all of it. Depending on how long that article is, I may even go into the first play-testing session where I learned that I new very little about balance.

&lt;p&gt;Hey all. I’m back with another semi-weekly article on the journey of creating a home-brew Spirit. After coming up with an idea for a Spirit, I had to do additional research in order to make sure that the idea fit thematically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thematic Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with a simple google search. Something along the lines of “phenomenon found in deserts” and went from there. From the list of resulting sites I made a list of ideas that could potentially be used to create a desert/antlion based Spirit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oasis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mirage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Haboob/Sandstorm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desert Heat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cactus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desert Varnish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flash Floods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quicksand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I decided to figure out the play style. My initial reaction was to embrace the antlion fantasy of gathering in Invaders and then destroying them. Both would most likely be Innate Powers. In order to facilitate that, I needed a Special Rule (or two) that would allow the theme to come through into the mechanical realm of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I settled on the following Special Rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presence can only be placed in the Sands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Presence is placed, gather 1 Explorer or 1 Town or 1 Dahan into that same land.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: The astute player will notice that there is definitely something wrong with this Special Rule, but we’ll get into that in a later article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I decided to get a little weird and add one more that I thought might be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plant and Water Elements count as Sun instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted the Spirit to be unique and play differently, and to me this last rule would help set it up to be different enough from the other Spirits because it would most likely contain high numbers of Sun Elements in its Innate Power Element thresholds. I was fascinated by the idea of having a Spirit whose final Innate Power Element threshold was something around the magnitude of 10 Sun Elements to trigger. A card that provided a Sun, Water, and Plant Symbol would instead generate 3 Sun Elements. You’ll see how this Special Rule fared in future articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now that I had a basic idea of Special Rules and some ideas for Innate Powers, I went back to the thematic research and began crafting the Unique Power Cards. I took the same list and jotted down ideas for each thing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oasis

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove a blight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather Invaders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather Dahan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mirage

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather Invaders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Haboob/Sandstorm

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Destroy Explorers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Destroy Towns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push Explorers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push Towns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skip Actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desert Heat

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deal damage with extra in Sands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cactus

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wilds tokens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desert Varnish

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flash Floods

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ultimately decided against trying to describe this one since River had a Flash Flood card already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quicksand

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wilds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beasts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Destroy Explorers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Singing Sand Dunes (Look it up, it’s pretty cool)

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather Explorers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did realize at a later date that Quicksand isn’t actually a desert thing (as portrayed in movies) since its composition requires a decent amount of water, which isn’t something that deserts are particularly rife with. Hindsight is 20/20, so I decided to go with it at the beginning since it seemed so versatile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a Computer Scientist by trade and I find that naming things is incredibly difficult sometimes. As such, I waffled all over the place trying to come up with a name for this Spirit.

I threw around other weird names like Shifting Sand’s Black Blizzard, or even Desert As An All Consuming Void (blech). It was really hard. Then I finally settled on &lt;strong&gt;Shifting Desert’s Gaping Maw&lt;/strong&gt;. It just felt right saying it and reading it on paper, so that’s what I went with. The name has grown on me since then and I don’t think I’ll change it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Elements: Water/Earth (Water = Sun)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scorch with Desert Heat

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 Cost, Slow, Range 1 from Sand, Any land&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Damage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;+1 Damage if target land is Sand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elements: Sun/Fire/Air&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Singing Dunes of Sand

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 Cost, Slow, Range 1 from Sand, Any land&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 Fear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather up to 2 Explorers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elements: Earth/Sun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thrashing Walls of Sand

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 Cost, Slow, Range 1 from Sand, Any land&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Destroy 1 Explorer and 1 Town&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elements: Air/Sun&lt;/li&gt;

It got a bad taste in my mouth because I would be the one setting up and tearing down the games, just as long as we would play.. I stopped trying to have game nights and moved away from the hobby. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t until I saw a local board game group playing in a community room at a grocery store that I remembered my love for gaming. I sat and watched them finish their game and they invited me to join on the next. It was so amazing having people who wanted to play for a change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go every week now. I have made new friends and expanded the game library I&amp;#39;ve played way more than I ever thought I would. Basically what I&amp;#39;m saying is check out local board game groups that get together every week. It is incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

752,,boardgames,"Last week I ran my usual June martial arts summer camp. We were scheduled to go play in the park one morning, but got rained out. Fortunately, I'd set a contingency should this happen: a ""megagame.""

I made a [YouTube summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpmPhlgquc8&amp;feature=youtu.be) of it, but for those who would rather read: I pitched it to the kids as ""like a boardgame, except you're the pieces. You will all be generals moving around trying to conquer territory. We'll play for about an hour and whoever has conquered the most territory at the end OR who has conquered the other team's capital will win. Sound good?""

Martial arts tends to attract introverts, often the nerdy variety (such as myself), so most of them were excited, others went along because kids just do that, and the rest did because everyone else was. There were 15 kids in camp that day, aged 6-12. With an odd number and the oldest kid looking skeptical, I made an on-the-fly modification to what I'd jotted down for the rules: one team would have a king who had no power, but would be the big-picture person who could walk around and suggest where the other kids should be going and aiming for.

I asked for volunteers and got three (the three I expected would). I put the oldest (previously skeptical) one as the sole king on one side, the two younger ones as ""dual kings"" on the other. Boy did leadership have a huge effect!

[Early in the game](https://imgur.com/S8vsKNx)

I won't dive into the full nitty-gritty of the game, but there were red and white teams, each with wiffle golf balls for armies (we normally use them for bullets and the like in other games). Each general got a d6, 3 armies, to start and could move 1 mat ""square"" per turn, optionally leaving an army behind to control it. Moving through a square already controlled gave an extra movement.

Objectives were forts, villages, a port, monsters to fight for unknown rewards, and the other team. At castles, forts, and villages, players could attempt to recruit more armies instead. One of my assistant instructors roamed handling the dice rolls for white team, while I did the same for red and handled any combats.

While some kids focused on expanding territory, the focus of both teams was to take the ports and when the first was conquered, I told them about ships and the far island with a giant guarding a powerful artifact. Both teams built their first, turned a general into an admiral, and sent them off towards the island. After a sea battle, red's admiral had to retreat onto a reef (a sai laid in an ocean ""square"") and lost everything, giving white dominance of the deep sea and the island. This turn eventually led to red's victory.

[The serpent driven to white's capitol. Admirals in the far distance heading for the island](https://imgur.com/yJGI22W)

With the island in white hands, red's (brilliant) king decided they needed to decisively crush the poorly-defended white capitol before white beat the giant and got the artifact with whatever power it gave. He organized and orchestrated a perfectly timed meeting of three generals adjacent to the white capitol at the same time two ships from the other side of the game world landed on a beachhead at the capitol's rear.

The white kings were both hanging out at the island, excited about the giant and didn't notice the approach and buildup until their capitol was under attack from 5 generals and \~25 armies against their defense of a castle, 2 generals, and &lt;10 armies.

White rushed all their mainland generals to help and had some lucky rolls that let them hold out longer than expected against the red juggernaut, but were on the brink of losing when the two admirals across the game world took out the giant and claimed its artifact, giving them extra dice in combat and also allowing them to fly!

[Fighting the giant](https://imgur.com/obaf0gP)

They could have swooped in and conquered the completely undefended red capitol, but instead dropped their troops at their capitol, taking the numeric odds from 5:1 to 3:1 against them. Even with the power of the artifact, the odds were too great and they were buried under the red juggernaut.

The game ended up lasting \~2 hours with even the 6 year-olds locked-in the whole time. The only one who got bored was the red king who, after seeing his final plan was in motion, headed off to beat up a Wavemaster for the last half-hour, returning only briefly when white's admirals flew in. He prudently directed a general to protect their capitol against white realizing they could fly there, then returned to his attack on the Wavemaster.

Overall, the game was a great hit! With a few post-game tweaks and improvements it's now my new go-to activity if we get rained out of the pool or park!

Hello beautiful humans of r/boardgames!

I love board games. They've had my heart since my friend dragged me to the board game club at my undergrad and got me to play Terra Mystica with him. He also only half taught it, let me be Chaos Magicians on my first go, said it didn't matter where I started, and immediately backed me into a corner making for a horrific game. BUT I WAS HOOKED and needed to figure out the game and then more and more games. So many games.

In fact I was buying more games from my local shop when I overheard another customer be mocked by their friend and a an employee for buying a party game.He was met with comments like ""Oh, he's new to gaming"" and ""he'll get there.""

Please stop doing this to our new folk. Everyone is new to gaming at some point. It can be fun to explore new and increasingly more complex games. It can also be fun to whip out Exploding Kittens and Coup. A lot of these serve as gateway games that get people more involved. Don't make them feel more excluded from the beginning.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now, you're allowed to be uninterested in playing these games. There are hundreds of games I would rather play than Catan for instance. So many games I think are leagues better even at the same difficulty level. Heck, I'd rather play Twilight Imperium three times in a row on no sleep then sit through another game of Catan in my life, however, when someone tells me they love it, I say ""awesome, it's considered a modern classic for a reason!"" And then I recommend something else they may also like to see if they are willing to try.**

**Never yuck the yum of someone else. Be nice to the people who are entering gaming. I've met so many people that will said they were intimidated by the gaming community. Be bright and welcoming and meet them where they are. Small comments matter. How we talk about things we don't like matters. Spread the love of gaming, don't squash it.**

&amp;#x200B;

**And for the love of all things holy, don't let a newbie be Chaos Magicians on their first Terra playthrough.**

[https://imgur.com/a/yMnagM9](https://imgur.com/a/yMnagM9)

Hey everyone, long time subscriber to /bg but I don't post much. I've gone through a few buying/selling waves, and I finally feel as though things are right where I want them. I go through having interest in a lot of games, to over-purchasing and being stressed out about the amount of games not being played. I've tried very intentionally over the last year to ONLY have on-hand what I actually want as part of my permanent collection. Twilight Imperium was the hardest to get rid of, but I honestly feel more free mentally now that it's gone :)

&amp;#x200B;

Recently got rid of:

\- 7th continent

\- Gloomhaven

\- Descent 2nd Ed.

&amp;#x200B;

How long have I ben in le hobby: I would say probably 8-10 years since I bought Catan for the first time, but it really ramped up to a main source of entertainment in the past 4-5 years

&amp;#x200B;

What would I change about my collection: I don't feel like I would change much at this point. I got rid of Gloomhaven recently, which was another weight off of my shoulders

&amp;#x200B;

Interesting tidbits: I'm in the process of magnetizing all of the Kingdom Death Armor sets, which is turning out to be a very challenging and rewarding process!

&amp;#x200B;

Not pictured: Monikers (not sure where it is at the moment)

&amp;#x200B;

Unplayed:

\- Shadows of Brimstone (just got a few weeks ago)

\- Sword &amp; Sorcery (just got a few weeks ago)

&amp;#x200B;

Centerpiece:- KDM for sure

\- Titan and High Frontier as runner ups

&amp;#x200B;

Waiting on KS:

\- Eclipse 2nd Ed

\- Space Race

\- Considering Middara 

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE: I figured I would expand a bit on a couple things, as well as some lists I forgot to mention

Hardest games to get rid of:

* TI4: It's everything I've ever wanted in a game, but after 10+ plays I felt like I've seen all it has to offer, and I didn't want to invest more time going through the same frustrations/negotiations/etc for that length of time. If they ever choose to expand it, and I really hope they do, then I will probably go all-in again
* Dark Souls: I love the video game, and I went in on the KS. I had to get rid of it for financial reasons at the time, but I really wanted to learn it with some house rules to correct what people didn't like about it. But then again, I feel that KDM gives me the feel that I was going for by wanting that game.

&amp;#x200B;

Decision making process when buying a new game, or deciding what to keep/get rid of:

* first and foremost: Theme. That's the single most important factor for me. I LOVE space, scifi, and horror, so those games immediately grab me. After that is fantasy, and then things drop off from there.
* Second, I want there to be potential for experiencing new content. If I've felt like I've seen all that a game has to offer, then I quickly wonder if it has a lasting place in my collection. For KDM, I feel like I've barely scratched the surface, and the content (adventures) still to come excite me a lot. For games like TI4 and GH, I felt like I've seen it and experienced it, and didn't want to muster up the mental energy to get back into those worlds for just more of the same.

&amp;#x200B;

Oddballs:

* I've kept Talisman and Formula D for nostalgic reasons. I loved them when I was starting out, and I still think of those games very fondly. Plus selling them wouldn't get me much $, so for now they are there as relics of the past. I still get anxious about seeing un-played games on my shelf where I'm really conscious about QUANTITY and excess, but hey, for now they've managed to stay.

**Description from Boardgamegeek**:

The Grizzled is a cooperative game about survival in the trenches during the first World War where players win or lose together.

Each round, the current team leader will choose how many cards every player draws. Then, going around the table, players must either play a card in their hand or back out of the mission. Each card represents either threats to the team (such as mortar shells and weather conditions) or negative personality traits (such as frightened or obsessive). At the end of the round, more cards are added to the draw deck. The game ends only if the players can deplete the draw deck as well as their hands without letting time run out.

If one threat shows up too many times, the team fails the mission. The team must play their threats correctly in order to gain any progress. However, most of the information in a players hand remains secret throughout the game.

Planning, teamwork, and a little luck are the tools you'll need to win this cooperative game for two to five players.

It got the usual reddit treatment... actually it was on the whole hugely positive, with only a smattering of warnings that we'd never been seen alive (or sane) again.

Well, the weather did its best to keep us away (I should have known better than to organise travel on the Ides of March - although it is Lovecraft's death day after all), almost as though some eldritch forces were conspiring against us... but foolhardy investigators that we were, we forged ahead regardless...

It's taken me a while to recover, edit the photos, do the write-up and process the 3D scan data and print the 3D minis(!)...  plus just deal with what life throws at us, but 3 months later I finally [managed it](https://www.tabletoptribe.com/island-of-insanity-2019-cthulhu-event), and thought all you well-wishers from the previous post (not to mention the nay-sayers!) might like to read about it.

Well good luck on that because I'm here to give you games! We just hit 2m Subs here after hitting 1m about 8 months ago and while technically tabletop simulator is not a board game, it's how you can play board games!

If you don't know what [Tabletop simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/Tabletop_Simulator) is, it's a game that simulates playing thousands of different board games via [mods](https://steamcommunity.com/app/286160/workshop/) or some paid dlc for game. Some are more manual and some have varying levels of automation. Currently on sale in the steam summer sale for $10 too if you end up just deciding to buy.

How can you win? Simple, post a comment with the last board game you played and 12am est on the 27th I will use random.org to pick 4 users from the comments. The only stipulation is your account must be at least 60 days old and obviously once per person.

My last point of note, I figured if I'm going to post this I might as well post the discord group I'm in called [TTSClub](https://discord.gg/ydUQqg5), which as you can guess is a Tabletop Simulator group that plays a lot of games like Marvel Legendary, Space Base, Tzolk'In, Terraforming Mars, Roll/Race for the Galaxy, Ex Libris, Dice Forge, Underwater Cities, Five tribes, or Tyrants of the Underdark to name some played over the past few days. We are always looking for more people to play and most will teach the games they play. The group has a lot of users from the US and Europe plus some Aussies so games are played at all sorts of times of day.

edit: I wish reddit had a native giveaway feature but I opted to forgo using random.org in favor of reddits random feature as it saves a decent bit of time.

&lt;p&gt;How can you win? Simple, post a comment with the last board game you played and 12am est on the 27th I will use random.org to pick 4 users from the comments. The only stipulation is your account must be at least 60 days old and obviously once per person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My last point of note, I figured if I&amp;#39;m going to post this I might as well post the discord group I&amp;#39;m in called &lt;a href=""https://discord.gg/ydUQqg5""&gt;TTSClub&lt;/a&gt;, which as you can guess is a Tabletop Simulator group that plays a lot of games like Marvel Legendary, Space Base, Tzolk&amp;#39;In, Terraforming Mars, Roll/Race for the Galaxy, Ex Libris, Dice Forge, Underwater Cities, Five tribes, or Tyrants of the Underdark to name some played over the past few days. We are always looking for more people to play and most will teach the games they play. The group has a lot of users from the US and Europe plus some Aussies so games are played at all sorts of times of day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit: I wish reddit had a native giveaway feature but I opted to forgo using random.org in favor of reddits random feature as it saves a decent bit of time. The 4 &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/mnYSQXR""&gt;users&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=""/u/CleveRoh""&gt;/u/CleveRoh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""/u/c4seyj0nes""&gt;/u/c4seyj0nes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""/u/Amnertia""&gt;/u/Amnertia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""/u/davygravy1337""&gt;/u/davygravy1337&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

780,,boardgames,"Hello good people.

&amp;#x200B;

So first of all a bit of context , this is my previous thread:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c38bqg/board\_game\_ideas\_for\_a\_project/](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c38bqg/board_game_ideas_for_a_project/)

&amp;#x200B;

and there were a lot of excellent ideas in there, but unfortunatly we ended up just taking the card game ""war"" and doing a variant of it, it goes exactly like the original war game only it's in duos and the sum of the 2 cards drawn are the winners, and the cards were suppose to be massive to connec to the major theme.

&amp;#x200B;

Our instructor cut us down really hard and said we basically did nothing , we just added a dumb mechanic to an already existing game.

&amp;#x200B;

And I am inclined to agree with him, our game had basically no actual mechanics , it was luck based and the math thing were you need to calculate the sum only subtracted from the game itself.

&amp;#x200B;

So , here we are , basically 2 weeks from presenting our final project and we're basically holding our d\*\*\*\* in our hands.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my friend helped me brew an idea.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The game is played by an X amout of people (I am leaning towards 4 or 5).
2. The game is a take on the ""trouble in terrorist town"" mode for counter strike.
3. The game has rogue like / like mechanics , if the team dies it's game over , there are no do overs.
4. The game board is basically a maze with a lot of rooms , each room is numbered.
5. The point of the game is to obtain the treasure.
6. The game players will be divided in the beginning of each round to ""Good"" and ""Bad"" players, this would be done by each player drawing a card at the beginning of the game , no one can see the cards  , and your cards labels you as good or bad.
7. The good players are supposed to help the team obtain the treasure.
8. The bad players are supposed to kill the team and prevent them from obtaining the treasure.
9. Each player has 5 or 6 cards , the cards are basically the building blocks of the play area itself , for example: I am a bad player , I drew 6 random cards and one of them are telling me that in room 5 there are a swarm of monsters and if we enter this room without sufficent provisions or armor or whatever than the team dies , I then have to do my best to lead my team to this room.
10. The team progress as a single entity , there are no individual choices in the game , the game is progressed only when the MAJORITY of players have decided on a path to take.
11. The actual progression is done by using a dice , and depending on the numbers that got rolled.

&amp;#x200B;

This is basically the structure of the game, but I know I am missing some crucial stuff like how to shuffle the cards, good cards with bad cards? 2 individual stacks would be too conspicuous and the point is that no one can know who you are as a player ( good or bad ) right at the start of the round.

Another thing I am trobuled by is how we make the group progress without making it obvious that one player is trying to kill the team , for example if the dice landed on 6 and door number 4 is on the path , and one player REALLY INSISTS that we go there, it can cause the other players to suspect him and make him out to be a bad guy.

&amp;#x200B;

Also , if anyone can spot any more problems and that can be pointed out  I would really appriciate it.

Good ideas for improvement are also appriciated.

&amp;#x200B;

The game has to be played in intervals of 15-20 minutes per round.

[https://i.imgur.com/iT9Nm7O.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/iT9Nm7O.jpg)

So we've recently switched our TV room and gaming room. The old gaming room was just a 12x12 room and didn't leave much space with the table in there. I build the table in the spring and quickly realized it was much too big for that room. So we swapped the gaming room and TV room. Because really, you don't need much space to watch TV.

&amp;#x200B;

***Game table:***

[https://i.imgur.com/vYuRLkU.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/vYuRLkU.jpg) (top on)

[https://i.imgur.com/dy5orN7.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/dy5orN7.jpg) (top off)The table is based off the $150 Gaming table by Gaminggeek. Though it probably ended up costing closer to  double that in the end. This is a ""prototype"" as I built it out of pine to see if I could actually do it.. There's a bunch of minimal flaws, but it works as intended. I plan to build another one in the fall out of oak and gift this one to a friend.

It's vaulted, but I mostly prefer to play games with the top on. The only time we really use the vault now is for Mansions of Madness, so we can pause game for a few days without tearing down, and I can still play other games over top. Otherwise I don't really enjoy it, I find it to be harder to access the game board / components and find myself ""hunching"" over the table much more causing discomfort in the back.  The table size in total is roughly 4.5ftx4.5ft, with the vault being about 4x4.  Which is great for some games, but I also find much too big for others.

&amp;#x200B;

***Collection:***

[https://i.imgur.com/rhp9HnI.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/rhp9HnI.jpg)

I only really got into board games about 6 months ago. Before that all I really owned was **Catan** and **Smallworld**.. Two games that I will probably never play again. My Collection isn't large, but I feel like it has grown a decent bit, with quality games, in that amount of time.

Got the Kallax and intended to store my games vertically. Aborted that mission quickly as it made a mess inside the boxes.. specially since i have the broken token inserts for Scythe and Terraforming mars.

&amp;#x200B;

***Favorites:***

**Mansions of Madness -** My only real experience with a table top RPG, my Saturday night group is really enjoying it. We've only played two scenarios so far. Once we've completed / get sick of this, I will buy **Gloomhaven** and we'll tackle that. Also looking for recommendation of other similar games I could look into

**Terraforming Mars** \- Love the theme, love the engine building, way less complicated than I initially thought

**Scythe** \- Again love the theme, and this was the game that made me dive deep into the hobby.

**Dominion -**  Didn't know I enjoyed deck building until I played **Dominion**

**Wingspan -** Zero interest in the theme, didn't think I had bought into the hype but saw it on the shelf while browsing my LFGS and grabbed it on a whim as I was shocked to even see it there.. Turns out the wife and I both quite enjoy it.

&amp;#x200B;

***Least favorite:***

**Smallworld -**  fuck this game.

&amp;#x200B;

***Yet to play:***

**Root** \- waiting on the wife to be in the right mood to tackle it

**Spirit Island** \- Again, waiting on the wife, she's more likely to want to play a game she already knows, than to learn a new one, unless I catch her in the right mood. Having 3 young kids, one of which less than a year old = too tired to learn more often than not.

**Puerto Rico** \- Gift from some friends

**Clank in space -** next on the play list as it's been recommended to me multiple times on this subreddit. It's my most recent purchase

&amp;#x200B;

***Pre ordered / Kickstarted:***

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/vYuRLkU.jpg""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/vYuRLkU.jpg&lt;/a&gt; (top on)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/dy5orN7.jpg""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/dy5orN7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; (top off)The table is based off the $150 Gaming table by Gaminggeek. Though it probably ended up costing closer to  double that in the end. This is a &amp;quot;prototype&amp;quot; as I built it out of pine to see if I could actually do it.. There&amp;#39;s a bunch of minimal flaws, but it works as intended. I plan to build another one in the fall out of oak and gift this one to a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s vaulted, but I mostly prefer to play games with the top on. The only time we really use the vault now is for Mansions of Madness, so we can pause game for a few days without tearing down, and I can still play other games over top. Otherwise I don&amp;#39;t really enjoy it, I find it to be harder to access the game board / components and find myself &amp;quot;hunching&amp;quot; over the table much more causing discomfort in the back.  The table size in total is roughly 4.5ftx4.5ft, with the vault being about 4x4.  Which is great for some games, but I also find much too big for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collection:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/rhp9HnI.jpg""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/rhp9HnI.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only really got into board games about 6 months ago. Before that all I really owned was &lt;strong&gt;Catan&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Smallworld&lt;/strong&gt;.. Two games that I will probably never play again. My Collection isn&amp;#39;t large, but I feel like it has grown a decent bit, with quality games, in that amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got the Kallax and intended to store my games vertically. Aborted that mission quickly as it made a mess inside the boxes.. specially since i have the broken token inserts for Scythe and Terraforming mars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Favorites:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mansions of Madness -&lt;/strong&gt; My only real experience with a table top RPG, my Saturday night group is really enjoying it. We&amp;#39;ve only played two scenarios so far. Once we&amp;#39;ve completed / get sick of this, I will buy &lt;strong&gt;Gloomhaven&lt;/strong&gt; and we&amp;#39;ll tackle that. Also looking for recommendation of other similar games I could look into&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terraforming Mars&lt;/strong&gt; - Love the theme, love the engine building, way less complicated than I initially thought&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scythe&lt;/strong&gt; - Again love the theme, and this was the game that made me dive deep into the hobby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dominion -&lt;/strong&gt;  Didn&amp;#39;t know I enjoyed deck building until I played &lt;strong&gt;Dominion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wingspan -&lt;/strong&gt; Zero interest in the theme, didn&amp;#39;t think I had bought into the hype but saw it on the shelf while browsing my LFGS and grabbed it on a whim as I was shocked to even see it there.. Turns out the wife and I both quite enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Least favorite:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smallworld -&lt;/strong&gt;  fuck this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yet to play:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Root&lt;/strong&gt; - waiting on the wife to be in the right mood to tackle it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spirit Island&lt;/strong&gt; - Again, waiting on the wife, she&amp;#39;s more likely to want to play a game she already knows, than to learn a new one, unless I catch her in the right mood. Having 3 young kids, one of which less than a year old = too tired to learn more often than not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/strong&gt; - Gift from some friends&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clank in space -&lt;/strong&gt; next on the play list as it&amp;#39;s been recommended to me multiple times on this subreddit. It&amp;#39;s my most recent purchase&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pre ordered / Kickstarted:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coloma&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Iwari&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;On Mars&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Terraforming Mars: Turmoil&lt;/strong&gt; (with all other expansions), &lt;strong&gt;Everdell Collectors edition&lt;/strong&gt; and  &lt;strong&gt;Dwellings of Eldervale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For me that game is **Warhammer: Invasion**. It was the second modern game I bought and I loved it.

791,,boardgames,"Here are the rules as I was able to understand them:

Each player takes a different colored backgammon piece and places it on either side of the board.

The goal is to get your pieces to the opponents side of the board.

Each player on their turn rolls two dice, and moves that many ""spaces"" (note, space size is completely arbitrary so any roll is sufficient to get to the other side of the board.)

While the active player (from now on referred to as the ""attacker"") is moving, the inactive player (the ""defender"") can block by putting their piece in front of the attacking player's piece as they move.

When the defending player blocks, the attacking player destroys all the pieces of the defending player. If destroyed, the attacking player stops moving, and the defending player removes their destroyed pieces from the game and places another piece of their color on their side of the board.

However, piece destruction can be avoided if the defending player initiates rebuilding upon being attacked. To do this, the defending player says ""Actually, I was rebuilding"" and places a piece of their color on top of their stack of pieces. After rebuilding, the attack stops and the turn passes to the defending player.

The attacking player has an option when the defender rebuilds, their special move. To do this, the attacker takes their stack of pieces in the air above the defending player's pieces and slams them down, destroying all pieces in the defender's stack. (NOTE: use of the special move is only available to my nephew. Other players have no special move.)

The game ends when one player runs out of backgammon pieces to keep rebuilding, or forfeits in the face of my nephews awesome power.

I loved the race mode in the 1+2 edition, but I think it have a lot of margin to improve.

Thinks I made for now:

* I painted the penguins. That's only a visual upgrade.
* I started to made Power ups (Like if you are playing Mario Kart):
   * Slow: Just a little magnet you trhow to the floor. (The base of the penguins is attracted to them and makes it move slower)
   * Barrier: Just a card with an Ice Wall painted in them that you put on a door with a piece of fish to make it stay there.
   * Jumper: A triangle shapped platform that you can use to block or to use as a ramp to ease jumping.
   * Sticky: A "" jelly ""  puddle  made of something like rubber materia. When the penguins go on top of there, the friction increase a lot and they get stickied.
   * Cleaner: You can remove one of the previous elements from the game.
   * Turbo: Get another turn.

&amp;#x200B;

Thinks I still want to improve:

* More power ups or improve the current ones.
* Make an equilibrated system to get those power ups.
* A way to insert the emerald fish miniexpansion to the race mode. (They love the emerald fish)
* A better way to score. (I love the race mode, but they would love a lap system or fish recoletion system and racing to get X score)

810,,boardgames,"**Note: I haven’t played Bio-Terrorist yet as I only played it solo.**

In *Pandemic*, you and your teammates work together to prevent a worldwide chaos.

 In Pandemic: On the Brink, things get messier: a disease that spreads in weird, unexpected ways; a 5th disease; a bio terrorist! 

Let’s go over each one. 

#**Virulent Strain**

In the **Virulent Strain** challenge, the usual epidemics are swapped out for the Virulent Strain ones. The Virulent Strain (from now on I’ll call it “VS”) epidemics change the VS disease (which I’m going to call VSD and which is determined by the amount of cubes of each disease at the end of the *Infect* step of the first VS epidemic; the one with the most cubes is the VS disease) in weird and unpredictable ways. 

An example for a VS effect: when a VSD card is drawn in the Infect Cities step at the end of the turn you need to draw one more infection card than the usual. 

I felt that while it’s really cool and I had a lot of fun with it, some of the VS epidemics are too specific: for example, one of them happens only if the disease is eradicated. If the disease isn’t eradicated, it’s just a regular epidemic. 

Idea: 8/10

Execution: 9/10

Overall: 9/10

#**Mutation Challenge**

In the **Mutation Challenge**, you try to prevent a 5th purple disease that only has 12 cubes but is only put on the board with special events and infection cards. To win this you have to either cure all 5 diseases (the new one is cured by discarding any mix of 5 cards, when at least 1 of the cities has a purple cube on it) or cure the 4 base diseases while having no purple cubes on the board. 

I found this challenging yet fun. I think that it’s a great execution of an amazing concept. 

Idea: 10/10

Execution: 10/10

Overall: 10/10

#**New Roles and Events** 

This expansion adds 6 roles and 8 events. Not all the events are shuffled in the player cards deck: from the combined total of this and regular Pandemic (13 events) only 2 per player are shuffled in the deck. This is done *before* you draw the 4 starting cards. The events are very interesting and I quite frankly liked to get them just for the excitement of using one of these so well-crafted events. 

The roles, too, are fantastic and a lot of fun. I especially liked the Field Operative, which lets you put up to 3 cubes of a certain color on the role card when treating a disease and then using these 3 cubes instead of 2 cards when finding a cure - so you only need 3 cards and 3 cubes to cure a disease. 

**Roles score:**

Idea: 9/10

Execution: 9/10

**Events score:**

#**Overall opinion of the expansion**

I think this expansion is a must-have. It’s really exciting and adds a lot of challenge. The roles, events and new game modes are amazing. I rate this expansion 9.5/10. I really think that if you have the money for it and you like Pandemic, you should buy it.

813,,boardgames,"I've bought a few new board games recently, and the variety of packaging and componentry got me thinking about what some games do well, and others do very badly.

The biggest issue for me is when a game has a lot of cards, but doesn't have room for sleeved cards in the box. It's bad enough when they don't fit in the inserts, but I've had card-based games where sleeved cards won't fit even with a removed insert (due to the extra height or width of the sleeves in a too-snug box).

As far as more minor things:

* Games that include pencils but no sharpeners. (Bonus points to Trapwords for actually including one with its pencils.)
* Games that include baggies that are either way too small, or ridiculously big for their components. (Stonemaier gets kudos for being generally really good at including appropriate bags with their games.)
* Games with unnecessarily large boxes for their components -- I don't need a 10""x10"" box for a game that literally consists of a dozen cards and a few wooden cubes. (Expansions often seem to be particularly guilty of this, although at least you can then just combine things into the single, original box.)
* Games that have consumable components (such as Roll and Write games) that don't allow purchase of replacement components and don't make them easy to photocopy (due to colors being an important part of the game, or generally being too contrasty to work in black and white).

831,,boardgames,"Hello /r/boardgames, 

Recently a new Kickstarter caught my eye called **[""Roll Player - Fiends &amp; Familiar](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1152516291/roll-player-fiends-and-familiars-expansion)""**. Being really new to the Kickstarter scene (this year), I did some research and decided to back it. 

Since I don't have the game, I would need to do the **All In Pledge** which included Base Game, Monster &amp; Minions Expansion, Fiends &amp; Familiar Expansion, &amp; the Big Box to fit everything in for $159 US. 

Since I wanted to play the Base Game before pledging (I pledged and still haven't played it yet), I noticed it was cheaper than the actual pledge level with Base Game.

I then did the math of pledging Monster &amp; Minions + Fiend &amp; Familiars with the Big Box and realized if I bought Monster &amp; Minions from retailer, I would save 3 more dollars + added shipping costs. 

Anyways the **TLDR**: *If you're backing this Kickstarter, only get the Fiends &amp; Familiar expansion, you can find the other games cheaper elsewhere with retailers.*

**The Math**: In US Dollars (I'm Canadian)

* *All In Pledge*: 159 (Kickstarter - Shipping not included in the price here)
* *All In Separate*: 43.53 (base) + 37.99 (Monsters &amp; Minions) + 59(Fiends &amp; Familiar and Big Box) = 140.52

If it wasn't for the Big Box I would've just waited for the game to hit retailer. Based on my research they didn't have Kickstarter Exclusive items.

The price for the All In Separate came from Amazon, retailer listings on Board Game Geek, and a few local retailers which listed the game. Keep in mind if you order off Amazon you're also getting Free Shipping (If Prime) so you would also be saving the shipping cost on top of everything).",t2_c4lu0,False,,0,False,"[Crowdfunding] Heads up for those planning to back ""Roll Player - Fiends &amp; Familiar"" All-In pledge level.","[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Crowdfunding'}]",r/boardgames,False,6,,0,,False,t3_c5wi9n,False,dark,,public,0,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Crowdfunding,False,0,,self,1561585998.0,,[],{},,True,,1561614413.0,richtext,6,,text,self.boardgames,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello &lt;a href=""/r/boardgames""&gt;/r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently a new Kickstarter caught my eye called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1152516291/roll-player-fiends-and-familiars-expansion""&gt;&amp;quot;Roll Player - Fiends &amp;amp; Familiar&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. Being really new to the Kickstarter scene (this year), I did some research and decided to back it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I don&amp;#39;t have the game, I would need to do the &lt;strong&gt;All In Pledge&lt;/strong&gt; which included Base Game, Monster &amp;amp; Minions Expansion, Fiends &amp;amp; Familiar Expansion, &amp;amp; the Big Box to fit everything in for $159 US. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I wanted to play the Base Game before pledging (I pledged and still haven&amp;#39;t played it yet), I noticed it was cheaper than the actual pledge level with Base Game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then did the math of pledging Monster &amp;amp; Minions + Fiend &amp;amp; Familiars with the Big Box and realized if I bought Monster &amp;amp; Minions from retailer, I would save 3 more dollars + added shipping costs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways the &lt;strong&gt;TLDR&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;If you&amp;#39;re backing this Kickstarter, only get the Fiends &amp;amp; Familiar expansion, you can find the other games cheaper elsewhere with retailers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Math&lt;/strong&gt;: In US Dollars (I&amp;#39;m Canadian)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;All In Pledge&lt;/em&gt;: 159 (Kickstarter - Shipping not included in the price here)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;All In Separate&lt;/em&gt;: 43.53 (base) + 37.99 (Monsters &amp;amp; Minions) + 59(Fiends &amp;amp; Familiar and Big Box) = 140.52&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it wasn&amp;#39;t for the Big Box I would&amp;#39;ve just waited for the game to hit retailer. Based on my research they didn&amp;#39;t have Kickstarter Exclusive items.&lt;/p&gt;

846,,boardgames,"Holy freaking crap.. this game is tough.  There are so many moving parts. My crew of 5 felt so overwhelmed and I would consider us somewhat intelligent, but holy freaking crap this game is tough.

&amp;#x200B;

I had played a couple of solo playthroughs prior to playing with others and had even watched RTFM's video ([https://youtu.be/RL\_WqY3L4SA](https://youtu.be/RL_WqY3L4SA)) to feel somewhat comfortable with it, but, naw, i didn't know what the heck I was doing.

&amp;#x200B;

So set-up begins, and we basically spend an hour scratching our heads like a handful of neanderthals over all the various parts of the game to a point of hilarity.  Everyone looked like they had glaucoma by the end of the set-up, but I said, let's just dive in.

&amp;#x200B;

So we dove...  nay, I kicked us into the Lovecraft Abyss and insanity hit us an hour later (now, 2 hours into game night) when we realized we were still in the first round.  It probably was piss-poor management on my part and I'll confess, I really should have 'studied' this game.  But I wish you all could have experienced five grown men frustrate ourselves to the point of full laughter.  But... I enjoyed it.  In all the frustration, I kept thinking, yea, we're definitely going to lose, but I want more.  And I was having this internal conflict inside of me thinking... dare I ask these men to delve into this experience again?  Will they think me insane?  Hath Cthulhu taken his hold on my mind?

&amp;#x200B;

After 3.5 hours of making it only 5 rounds, Yoth-Sothoth wrecked us.  What I learned is BUY STUFF, BUY IT ALL...  equipping is so important, and we really only discovered the importance of assets after chasing our tails across the map.

&amp;#x200B;

Combat still doesn't make 100% sense to me.  So if any of you are bored and want to ELI5, please do.  There was a massive debate at the table and the winning ""ideal"" of combat made it seem like monsters were impossible to beat for some players' characters.  That just made the game even MORE challenging (think Demon Souls the video game).

&amp;#x200B;

I think everyone walked away last night feeling schooled, ill-equipped, and outright frustrated.  There were rules we were learning (like clues being able to be used for re-rolls) halfway through the game.  One of my guys failed to mention to me that they didn't realize they could close gates after combat, I swear I had said that they could, but maybe I didn't?  Needless to say, outside of just knowing the rules better and being a better guide, what could I have done to prepare everyone for an evening of Eldritch Horror?  What tips/strategies have worked for you?

850,,boardgames,"A gaming buddy of mine recently suggested that we play through all of the old ones of Eldritch Horror in order or release, only using the cards and mechanics that were available when the set was released. So for the past two weeks we have been playing with just the base box, with the exception of a few monsters that got mixed in from later sets. It’s been a long time since I played EH since my regular group is normally 5 or more, and I always want to play with everything, which can make for a long, unwieldy game.

I just want to say how glad I am that he suggested we do this. I had forgotten how much I really enjoy this game, and the past two games have been super fun. I really feel like the game does an amazing job of create interesting stories for your characters. We’ve been playing with 2 characters each and it’s been a blast. The first game I played the actress and the former cultist. The actress ended up using her charm to gain followers, and eventually got a hold of some dynamite which she used to obliterate a sizable group of monsters. The cultist was a magical powerhouse, but her weak will got her into a few binds.

This week I was the psychic, who started as a powerful magic user, but then had to sacrifice much of her spell casting ability to solve a mystery of the old one. After that she became an explorer going between the Amazon and the pyramids to collect a bevy of powerful relics, disguising herself as a monster to avoid confrontations. My other character was Lily Chen, who traveled the world, improving her skills across the board and becoming a formidable asset for any situation. There was a tight spot at the end where most of our team was draw to the Bermuda Triangle and delayed, but we pulled the victory out in the end.

If you like games that create memorable stories, this is the one to go with. Even just the base game is a blast, and there were really only two issues I saw, both easily fixed with expansions:

1. The focus action: There was always something to do in the game, but once in awhile there wasn’t something good to do with your second action. The focus action fixes this, giving you one more action that is always useful. And if you provide your own tokens, you don’t even need an expansion to incorporate this into your game.

2. Card variety: Two games in and we did see at least one card/scenarios come up again. It’s not the worst thing, since they will still play out differently story wise based on your character, but the expansions all add some cards to the decks.

Honestly it’s a great game full of fun and adventure, and one game where I never care that I lost, because it always provides fun memories. If you haven’t ever played, give it a try. If you haven’t played for awhile, it might be worth revisiting. I never thought of it as a two player game, but it was just as good at that count, maybe even better.  It’s easy for me to get distracted with so many new games coming out, but I sure am glad I revisited this one.

Happy Tuesday, /r/boardgames!

This is a weekly thread to discuss train games and 18xx games, which are a family of economic train games consisting of shared ownership in railroad companies. For more information, [see the description on BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/19/18xx). There’s also a subreddit devoted entirely to 18xx games, /r/18xx, and a subreddit devoted entirely to **[Age of Steam](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4098/age-steam)**, /r/AgeOfSteam.

Here’s a nice guide on [how to get started with 18xx](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/4sygx3/how_to_get_started_with_18xx/?st=iqny4loj&amp;sh=c01b5d88).

Feel free to discuss anything about train games, including recent plays, what you're looking forward to, and any questions you have. 

If you want to arrange to play some 18xx or other train games online, feel free to try to arrange a game with people via /r/playboardgames.

For reference, I have been in this hobby for a few years. Played lots of games growing up, but didn't get hardcore into the hobby until 3 years ago. 



I have played with lots of friends and family members over the years. I have played everything from party games to some serious brain burners. I have played with people who take a decent amount on their turn and people who play reasonably quickly.



I used to think people who played slowly or thought about their turn for a while have Analysis Paralysis (AP). However, I think for the first time I played against someone who actually has AP.  



A friend couple of ours who have been saying they want to play games with us because they like things like Catan, Carc, TTR, etc. I was excited because it could give my wife and I a couple to hang out with and play regularly. So finally we were able to get together and play. We were playing 5 player (fifth just was another friend who was over for dinner and decided to join us). 



We decided on Zooloretto (1.86/5.00 on BGG).



If you know anything about the game, Zooloretto uses the same draw a card, then place a card concept of Coloretto. For example, on one particular turn about halfway through the game, a player placed an animal on one of the trucks (1 truck w/ 1 animal and 4 trucks w/ 0 animals). 



Then it was AP person's turn. They drew an animal from the bag...and I kid you not...took over two and a half minutes deciding where to put it. This persons turns took between 3-8 minutes usually. Mostly just them staring at the board and being indecisive. Zooloretto took us over 1.5 hours and is normally a 45 minute game (or less lol).



Honestly, I love this couple. They are close to us. I just don't know if I can handle more nights like that. They have expressed interest in playing games like Scythe and Agricola, which I have raved about to to them prior to that evening. But as of now, I am definitely sticking to things like Zooloretto or Splendor or Biblios weight games if we ever do another game night. 


This was definitely my first actual AP encounter. And I finally gained an understanding of why people struggle playing with people who have AP. I used to think people were just being impatient. But this changed my perspective. I am usually super patient and I am fine with slow turns usually, but this was just outrageous. Any advice on what to do? Timers? Better rules explanations?

884,,boardgames,"For those that don't know, [Kingdom Death](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/55690/kingdom-death-monster) is a game that involves a huge amount of story creation. Our group's particular way of playing is that four of us sit down and play while our artist friend draws what happens. We also decided to theme our settlement (and its inhabitants) after Saturday morning cartoons. Here's what followed:

We elected to play a campaign called ""People of the Sun"", in which a small group of humans find a horrible monster in the middle of spawning its young and decide to worship it. [Dilbert, Daria, Doctor Zoidberg, and Wilma Flintstone all took a turn drinking the water from the monster's spawning pool](https://i.imgur.com/JKteIf4.jpg), while the horrible beast observed from above.

The survivors then set out to start hunting monster prey, to collect resources and build their settlement. [Daria was the first to go, when her head was exploded by a White Lion.](https://i.imgur.com/USMeWQm.jpg)

[Doctor Zoidberg fell next](https://i.imgur.com/hGqhYWT.jpg), clawed to death by another White Lion.

Screams erupted from the darkness, and the survivors determined that it must be the call of a new monster: the Screaming Antelope. On the hunt to find this elusive monster, [Dilbert fell off a cliff, broke his leg, and wet himself.](https://i.imgur.com/jEK2ji7.jpg) He laid there for a long time, contemplating the futility of his existence.

The fight with the Screaming Antelope went better than the White Lion hunts, although Wilma Flintstone did fall in battle. [When the horrible beast opened it's screaming undermaw towards her she experienced a mental break and died of abject terror.](https://i.imgur.com/wtSrn3g.jpg)

Things started to turn around with the birth of our first Child of the Sun.  Proud parents [Tina Belcher and Morty proudly display their newborn daughter, Sailor Moon.](https://i.imgur.com/rWYoW0E.jpg) She will be our settlement's saviour.

With our new saviour online we made easy work of [increasingly higher level Screaming Antelopes](https://i.imgur.com/lT0pW8B.jpg). Even the horrible Pheonix fell to our survivors, although the first one we fought [did take down Goliath](https://i.imgur.com/57r6xzX.jpg), leader of the Gargoyles.

One of our settlement's biggest setbacks was the raucous party that we threw for some reason, in which we [destroyed every resource in the settlement](https://i.imgur.com/1nPKkz3.jpg). Seen here: Morty destroying resources, Sailor Moon and Waldo fucking in public, Dilbert throwing useful monster bits into the fire, and CatDog looking on sadly.

We continued to have our fair share of tough hunts. Such as the time when everyone decided to go fishing around in a river of blood and faeces to try and catch the monster's trail. [Morty did manage to find some interesting monster bits, but Sailor Moon, Babar, and Nigel Thornberry just spent the whole time puking](https://i.imgur.com/hQsepLe.jpg). A nightmare whale swam overhead, as the Pheonix eluded us.

Finally, we reached the campaign endgame, which involves fighting an increasingly powerful gauntlet of villains in a row before taking on the final boss. The Kingsman fight went very smoothly. It went SO well that [Patrick the starfish decided to take a break from the battle to root around in a nearby monster corpse for extra resources](https://i.imgur.com/LbREnrp.jpg). Inside he found a Dung Beetle Knight eyeball, which he quickly consumed for +30 insanity. Nigel Thornberry, Yogi Bear, and DW fought on without him.

We weren't so fortunate in our battle with the Butcher. Throughout the course of the fight the Butcher ripped off the faces of Love-a-lot-Bear, Bradley from Stickin' Around, and... Sailor Moon's dear father Morty! [Although Sailor Moon was able to deliver the killing blow to the Butcher by herself, the grief of losing her father was too great](https://i.imgur.com/ruVsYpR.jpg).

890,,boardgames,"I wanted to share back to Reddit as someone a long time ago posted something here or there about the IVAR modular shelf system from IKEA. I was investigating the KALLAX shelf but felt limited because of the square sizes. After a lot of research, I decided to give the IVAR a try, and I chose to use the 70"" tall by 20"" deep shelf, and the shelves are 33"" wide. I ended up buying 9 shelves. You can check out the 9-shelf set-up at this imgur link: [https://imgur.com/a/RDEXOv5](https://imgur.com/a/RDEXOv5)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really happy with the setup: some longer games like my Dominion Big Box and Monopoly and Labyrinth and Secret Hitler can now all fit in long-ways. True, for most games the 20"" depth is a little too much - but it works well for me!

&amp;#x200B;

I am now in love the IVAR system - I am thinking now about buying more materials and keeping them in the attic in case I need to expand my shelving. You can buy as few or as many (up to a point) shelves as you want.  You can buy more shelves or side pieces and it can grow as the collection grows. Here's a link to one of the SIDE pieces  you'd need - notice the variables on height and depth. Then your choice of shelf width finalizes the dimensions.

 [https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/73755709/](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/73755709/) 

 

 **Pros** to buying this over the KALLAX:

· Modular set up means you can customize the overall size of the unit to your needs.

· Modular set up means you can add as many shelves as you’d like – this is helpful so that you don’t have to stand up your board games sideways or stack too many on top of each other.

· Price is mostly in-line with KALLAX – for me it was around $120 for the complete shelf unit, and KALLAX I think was around $109.

· Setup (without painting or staining) was incredibly easy and painless.

**Cons**

· You might feel a burning desire to stain or paint your shelf, adding more setup time.

· It doesn’t come with any instructions – you have to be prepared to figure it out on your own. What size do you need? What Shelf? Don’t forget to get the brace thingy for the back of the shelf! They don’t even really display it much at IKEA – I had to ask the salesperson where the display was (hidden in the back) so I could see it before I bought it.

· I guess it could tip over if you have small children who want to climb up the shelves – or you have to drill it into the wall to keep this from happening (perhaps you do this with KALLAX as well?)

· ?? other? You tell me.

&amp;#x200B;

**How long have you been collecting?**

I've been collecting board games now for about 7 years, and now have soon-to-be 4-year old that is getting interested in board games. I'm sure our collection will grow as he gets older! If anyone has any recommendations on great games for 4-year old boys, let me know.

**What changes would you make to your collection if you could?**

I am going to get rid of Canasta Caliente, Lift It, and Spite &amp; Malice - we never play these games, and are sub-par my personal standard of what's 'fun'. I am also looking to get more eurogames and maybe get into more hardcore RPF games (I grew up with Magic the Gathering so Dominion is up my alley, but scared that my wife can't handle harder, more rule-based strategy games). I have been trying to convince her to get me Gloomhaven :)

&amp;#x200B;

I also am not sure about if I should STAIN the shelf and if anyone has any feedback there I'd love to hear it. (Does the stain help it last longer? Does it even matter anyway since the shelf is indoors?  What colors are nice? etc)",t2_tsp5o,False,,0,False,Ivar Shelf from IKEA - pros cons vs Kallax,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'COMC'}]",r/boardgames,False,6,COMC,0,,False,t3_c4uavi,False,dark,,public,82,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},COMC,False,82,,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1561434222.0,richtext,6,,text,self.boardgames,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to share back to Reddit as someone a long time ago posted something here or there about the IVAR modular shelf system from IKEA. I was investigating the KALLAX shelf but felt limited because of the square sizes. After a lot of research, I decided to give the IVAR a try, and I chose to use the 70&amp;quot; tall by 20&amp;quot; deep shelf, and the shelves are 33&amp;quot; wide. I ended up buying 9 shelves. You can check out the 9-shelf set-up at this imgur link: &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/RDEXOv5""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/RDEXOv5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really happy with the setup: some longer games like my Dominion Big Box and Monopoly and Labyrinth and Secret Hitler can now all fit in long-ways. True, for most games the 20&amp;quot; depth is a little too much - but it works well for me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am now in love the IVAR system - I am thinking now about buying more materials and keeping them in the attic in case I need to expand my shelving. You can buy as few or as many (up to a point) shelves as you want.  You can buy more shelves or side pieces and it can grow as the collection grows. Here&amp;#39;s a link to one of the SIDE pieces  you&amp;#39;d need - notice the variables on height and depth. Then your choice of shelf width finalizes the dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt; to buying this over the KALLAX:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Modular set up means you can customize the overall size of the unit to your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Modular set up means you can add as many shelves as you’d like – this is helpful so that you don’t have to stand up your board games sideways or stack too many on top of each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Price is mostly in-line with KALLAX – for me it was around $120 for the complete shelf unit, and KALLAX I think was around $109.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Setup (without painting or staining) was incredibly easy and painless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· You might feel a burning desire to stain or paint your shelf, adding more setup time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· It doesn’t come with any instructions – you have to be prepared to figure it out on your own. What size do you need? What Shelf? Don’t forget to get the brace thingy for the back of the shelf! They don’t even really display it much at IKEA – I had to ask the salesperson where the display was (hidden in the back) so I could see it before I bought it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· I guess it could tip over if you have small children who want to climb up the shelves – or you have to drill it into the wall to keep this from happening (perhaps you do this with KALLAX as well?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· ?? other? You tell me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long have you been collecting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been collecting board games now for about 7 years, and now have soon-to-be 4-year old that is getting interested in board games. I&amp;#39;m sure our collection will grow as he gets older! If anyone has any recommendations on great games for 4-year old boys, let me know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What changes would you make to your collection if you could?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to get rid of Canasta Caliente, Lift It, and Spite &amp;amp; Malice - we never play these games, and are sub-par my personal standard of what&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;fun&amp;#39;.

It's a game where you have dinosaures (something like 8 species), and each turn you have to choose a dinosaure between the few you have in hand, show it to the others and then draft the rest of them to your neighboor.

Then you place the dinosaure you choose in your park, you have to put it by respecting a condition (like Forest Side, Toilet Side, Rock Side..) etc

There are placement rules and points by how you placed your dino in the park, making couples, having the majority in one species etc.

894,,boardgames,"I picked up Pandemic: Rapid Response on Friday and played it about 10 times over the weekend. Here are my thoughts.

**TL/DR**: If you like Pandemic and Kane Klenko, buy this game. Fun, fast, stressful dice-chucker.

**Summary**: In Pandemic: Rapid Response you are flying around the world on a giant disaster response airplane, bringing necessary supplies to locations in need. To do this, you are rolling dice to move your pawn, create supplies, fly the airplane, and drop supplies off to the people in need. But don't stop and think - this is real time, and if you aren't fast enough, you lose.

**Components**: This is a top-notch production. The board, cards, and components are great, but the dice ... oh, the dice are spectacular. You spend the majority of the game rolling and placing dice, so the fact that they are beautiful, solid, easy to see objects makes the game that much better. I can't think of better dice in a game.

**Set-up**: Getting the game ready to play is quick and painless. Everybody grabs their dice, pawn, and role card. Shuffle up a couple of small decks and distribute the cards as explained in the rule book. Put out some cubes and the timer. You're playing the game just a couple of minutes after opening the box.

**Game Play**: In P:RR you flip over the sand timer, and then take turns rolling and placing dice. It's the classic Yahtzee style, where you can re-roll up to 2 times. Each die can be used in multiple ways - move your pawn, assign to supply areas, move the plane, eliminate waste. While you want to maximize your dice usage, it can be just as useful to ignore some of your dice and pass to the next player. The only requirement in your turn is that you roll the dice you have once.

When the sand timer runs out you pause, add a new city to your list of trouble spots, and remove a time token. You start with 3 time tokens, and gain new ones when you successfully deliver supplies to a city. When you've mastered the flow of the game, you can add in Crisis cards. You flip over one Crisis card every time the timer runs out - these cards will randomly cause issues that need to be addressed.

If you get the appropriate supplies to all the cities before you run out of time tokens, you win. If you run out of time tokens, or if you generate too much waste, you lose.

**Difficulty Scaling**: There are four difficulty levels in the rule book, and I've played the first 3. Easy is just to learn the mechanics. If you have any experience with games you shouldn't lose. We only lost once on Normal, and haven't beaten Hard. You can then choose to add in Crisis cards, which makes whatever level you are playing at harder. You should be able to adjust the difficulty to be exactly as hard as you want.

**Player Count**: I've played this game at 2, 3 and 4 players, and it scales perfectly well. There are some slight strategy differences at 2P. For example, if you ""lock up"" your dice, the odds that another player will come by and finish that supply room are lower. There were a couple times at 2P where my wife and I were rapidly taking turns rolling 2 dice until we got that one icon to create supplies. In 4P that never happened. At the 4P count, it was easier for the players who were waiting for their turn to analyze the board and guide the other players. At 2P, there was a lot more ""Wait, what are we doing now?"" moments. Interestingly, there are absolutely no setup differences at the various player counts, and the game works great at all of them.

**Game Length**: Here is one example of the box telling the truth. Games take about 20 minutes - less if you flame out early. Because it's real-time, there's really no way for the game to take longer than advertised.

**General Thoughts**: This game is exactly what you would expect from a Pandemic/Kane Klenko mash-up. It has the real-time trappings that Klenko puts into games like FUSE and Flatline, with the Pandemic aesthetic. I expect this game will stay in my collection for a long time. You can take it out and be playing in less than 5 minutes, and games last 20 minutes or less. Any new gamer can pick up on it quickly, and you can scale the difficulty as much or as little as you want. My wife loves Pandemic and co-ops, and FUSE and Flatline are two of her favorite games - so this one just rocketed right up to the top of her list. The fact that you have to make decisions in a 20 minute co-op is cool. Do you wait to get one more die to help fill supplies later on, or grab what you need this second and run? Do we go for the hard city first or leave it to the end?

I've already played hundreds of games in the Pandemic franchise or Kane Klenko design school, so this one was a no-brainer for me. I play-tested it a year and a half ago, and knew I would buy it the first chance I had.

If you have any experience with games you shouldn&amp;#39;t lose. We only lost once on Normal, and haven&amp;#39;t beaten Hard. You can then choose to add in Crisis cards, which makes whatever level you are playing at harder. You should be able to adjust the difficulty to be exactly as hard as you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Player Count&lt;/strong&gt;: I&amp;#39;ve played this game at 2, 3 and 4 players, and it scales perfectly well. There are some slight strategy differences at 2P. For example, if you &amp;quot;lock up&amp;quot; your dice, the odds that another player will come by and finish that supply room are lower. There were a couple times at 2P where my wife and I were rapidly taking turns rolling 2 dice until we got that one icon to create supplies. In 4P that never happened. At the 4P count, it was easier for the players who were waiting for their turn to analyze the board and guide the other players. At 2P, there was a lot more &amp;quot;Wait, what are we doing now?&amp;quot; moments. Interestingly, there are absolutely no setup differences at the various player counts, and the game works great at all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game Length&lt;/strong&gt;: Here is one example of the box telling the truth. Games take about 20 minutes - less if you flame out early. Because it&amp;#39;s real-time, there&amp;#39;s really no way for the game to take longer than advertised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;: This game is exactly what you would expect from a Pandemic/Kane Klenko mash-up. It has the real-time trappings that Klenko puts into games like FUSE and Flatline, with the Pandemic aesthetic. I expect this game will stay in my collection for a long time. You can take it out and be playing in less than 5 minutes, and games last 20 minutes or less. Any new gamer can pick up on it quickly, and you can scale the difficulty as much or as little as you want. My wife loves Pandemic and co-ops, and FUSE and Flatline are two of her favorite games - so this one just rocketed right up to the top of her list. The fact that you have to make decisions in a 20 minute co-op is cool. Do you wait to get one more die to help fill supplies later on, or grab what you need this second and run? Do we go for the hard city first or leave it to the end?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve already played hundreds of games in the Pandemic franchise or Kane Klenko design school, so this one was a no-brainer for me. I play-tested it a year and a half ago, and knew I would buy it the first chance I had. This is one of those great times where the game lived up to expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

To preface, I do not consider myself a board game designer in any capacity, just a hobbyist who gets a little deep into the things that he’s interested in.

This is the first of many articles I plan on posting on a semi-weekly basis until finished.

**The Intro**

Ever since playing Spirit Island back in March of 2018, my wife and I fell in love with the game. We’ve played it countless times since then and it doesn’t show any signs of stopping. I backed Jagged Earth and await its arrival with bated breath.

Unlike blogs that don’t give you the recipe at the beginning, I’ll keep the story short so you don’t have to scroll any further to see what you came here to see.

I have been researching and playing around with creating a new Spirit for Spirit Island for the past two months or so and I thought it might be interesting to post my findings and discoveries somewhere where they might be appreciated and/or used by others in the future. I’ll be breaking this up into a few parts to show the design process that I went through.

To start off, I needed an idea. A concept for a Spirit that I wanted in the game. There weren't any real desert-based Spirits, just a bunch that start in the Sands. So I started there.

My original concept was to base a Spirit off of the idea of an antlion. An antlion is a creature that burrows into the sand and creates a trap for unsuspecting prey. A Spirit that would feel like an antlion would perform similar functions, gathering and devouring.

Now that I had an idea, I was ready to begin my research.

**The Research**

I started off with what made the most sense to me. I began analyzing every aspect of a Spirit I could think of. I tried to ask as many questions as I could. This would allow me to answer important future questions about my Spirit's play style and features in terms of what I already understood. I also want a database of numbers from which to draw from later.

**Unique Power Cards:**

* What is the distribution of Energy costs?
* What is the ratio of Slow vs Fast?
* How much could be done for the respective amounts of Energy spent?
* When combined with Slow or Fast, how much could be done with the Energy spent?
* Are Unique Power Cards more powerful than regular Minor Powers?

**Presence Tracks:**

* What were the minimum and maximum amounts of Energy generated among the Spirits?
* What is the average amount of Energy generated among the Spirits after removing outliers?
* What are the minimum and maximum number of Card Plays among the Spirits?
* Is there a correlation between complexity and Elemental symbols on Presence Tracks?

**Innate Powers:**

* How were the Elemental thresholds designed for the Innate Powers?
* How many thresholds are there for each Power?
* How hard is each threshold to obtain respective of each Spirit?

**Play Styles:**

* How many different kinds of overarching play styles were there?
* What were the attributes of said play styles?

**Growth Options:**

* How many growth options does each Spirit have?
* What is paired with the Reclaim All Growth option?
* How are Growth options different for Spirits that can pick two instead of one?
* What are general trends seen in Growth options?

&amp;#x200B;

With all of these questions in mind. I set out to learn as much as I could about the content that already exists (not including Jagged Earth since all we have is PnP stuff that's still being developed).

Now for the part you are waiting for, the results:

&amp;#x200B;

**Unique Power Cards:**

* The average cost is 1.167. Most Unique Power Cards cost between 0-3.
   * EDIT: Average cost is 1.167 instead of 2, I was definitely taking the wrong number ina  calculation. Most Power cards actually have values from 0-2. Thanks to user /u/DarthWindu7 for calling me out on it.
* The most common distributions are 2:2 or 3:1 Slow:Fast.
* This varies greatly, but they share a common distribution with the other Minor Powers in the deck.
* See previous answer.
* It depends, but generally they are of a similar or slightly greater power level than the Minor Powers.

**Presence Tracks:**

* Minimum is 2 (Ocean) and the maximum is 12 (Serpent).
* Removing outliers and taking into account growth options, most Spirits can generate on average 7-8 energy per turn with an empty energy track.
* Card plays range from 3-6 with the average hovering around 4-5
* In my research there seems to be a correlation. All of the Low Complexity Spirits lack symbols on their Presence Tracks with the exception of River, but Reclaim One isn't an element, so it gets a pass.

**Innate Powers:**

* It seems that the Elemental Thresholds were designed with the strongest level requiring nearly all of the Spirit's card plays or one less than that to activate. Spirits with elements in their Presence Tracks get some help with this.
* Most Innate Powers have 3 levels, with an occasional 4 levels on some.
* Without Elemental Symbols it requires most/all card plays to be centered on activating the Innate ability. Spirits with Elemental Symbols are usually impossible to trigger the Thresholds without their aid.

**Play Styles:**

* In general I found two overarching play styles. Innate based and Major Power based.
* Innate play style is based on getting cheap cost Minor Powers with the focus on triggering all levels of the Innate Power every turn. Major Power based is pretty straightforward. Get a lot of Energy to play 1-3 Major Powers each turn.

**Growth Options:**

* Most Spirits have 3 Growth options, with some having 4.
* Reclaim All is generally the weakest Growth option with the exception of Earth-based Spirits. Usually accompanied with gaining a Power Card or Energy.
* Spirits that can choose 2 Growth options generally have an option that is simply Energy gain.
* Most Spirits have 1 option that grants a Minor Power with some that grant 2. Placing Presence is similar. Most can place it with 1 option, while others can place it with 2 and still others can place 2 at once with a single option. Vital Strength is special and places Presence with all 3 Growth options.

&amp;#x200B;

And there you have it. That's a brief summary of everything without nuances. I can go into further details upon request, I love talking about this stuff. It is entirely possible while putting all of this down in one place I've missed some things, so bare that in mind since there's a lot of stuff here.

If you've come across insights similar or even opposite of those presented here, I would love to hear/discuss!

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of these questions in mind. I set out to learn as much as I could about the content that already exists (not including Jagged Earth since all we have is PnP stuff that&amp;#39;s still being developed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the part you are waiting for, the results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique Power Cards:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average cost is 1.167. Most Unique Power Cards cost between 0-3.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EDIT: Average cost is 1.167 instead of 2, I was definitely taking the wrong number ina  calculation. Most Power cards actually have values from 0-2. Thanks to user &lt;a href=""/u/DarthWindu7""&gt;/u/DarthWindu7&lt;/a&gt; for calling me out on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most common distributions are 2:2 or 3:1 Slow:Fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This varies greatly, but they share a common distribution with the other Minor Powers in the deck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See previous answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It depends, but generally they are of a similar or slightly greater power level than the Minor Powers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presence Tracks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimum is 2 (Ocean) and the maximum is 12 (Serpent).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removing outliers and taking into account growth options, most Spirits can generate on average 7-8 energy per turn with an empty energy track.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Card plays range from 3-6 with the average hovering around 4-5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my research there seems to be a correlation. All of the Low Complexity Spirits lack symbols on their Presence Tracks with the exception of River, but Reclaim One isn&amp;#39;t an element, so it gets a pass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innate Powers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It seems that the Elemental Thresholds were designed with the strongest level requiring nearly all of the Spirit&amp;#39;s card plays or one less than that to activate. Spirits with elements in their Presence Tracks get some help with this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most Innate Powers have 3 levels, with an occasional 4 levels on some.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without Elemental Symbols it requires most/all card plays to be centered on activating the Innate ability. Spirits with Elemental Symbols are usually impossible to trigger the Thresholds without their aid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play Styles:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general I found two overarching play styles. Innate based and Major Power based.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innate play style is based on getting cheap cost Minor Powers with the focus on triggering all levels of the Innate Power every turn. Major Power based is pretty straightforward. Get a lot of Energy to play 1-3 Major Powers each turn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growth Options:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most Spirits have 3 Growth options, with some having 4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reclaim All is generally the weakest Growth option with the exception of Earth-based Spirits. Usually accompanied with gaining a Power Card or Energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spirits that can choose 2 Growth options generally have an option that is simply Energy gain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most Spirits have 1 option that grants a Minor Power with some that grant 2. Placing Presence is similar. Most can place it with 1 option, while others can place it with 2 and still others can place 2 at once with a single option. Vital Strength is special and places Presence with all 3 Growth options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there you have it. That&amp;#39;s a brief summary of everything without nuances. I can go into further details upon request, I love talking about this stuff. It is entirely possible while putting all of this down in one place I&amp;#39;ve missed some things, so bare that in mind since there&amp;#39;s a lot of stuff here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve come across insights similar or even opposite of those presented here, I would love to hear/discuss!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time I&amp;#39;ll go deeper into the research of the thematic side of the Spirit: &lt;strong&gt;Shifting Desert&amp;#39;s Gaping Maw&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

**How long have you been involved in the hobby?**

Like most others, I played Monopoly when I was a kid in the 80s/90s. I also played some Risk and Axis &amp; Allies in late 90s. I was introduced to Catan in early 00s and was mesmerized with it and played a few times with a bunch of my poker gaming buddies and I promptly forgot about it after I moved out of the area. I bought Catan 3 years ago and played it only 3-4 times with my wife due to lack of time and other factors.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been collecting seriously only since Thanksgiving of 2018. There was a bunch of sale on boardgame apps on Android during mid last year. Bought and played a few such as TtR, Pandemic, Carcassone, etc. on my phone and was like ""I think my wife will enjoy playing more board games other than Catan"" and bought some gateway games during the holiday season sales last year. Of course, my wife ended up liking the games and I started buying a whole bunch of new games these past few months.

&amp;#x200B;

**What would you change about your collection if you could?**

I would like to own some medium-heavy/heavy weight games to my list but the problem is getting it to the table. We have 2 kids and we only get to play after we put them to bed either 2 player( or 4 player games with our neighbors who also have 2 young kids). They all want to play medium weight games so that we can play lot more games that way. No regrets about buying any game in my collection as we've played almost all of them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Favorite games:**

Terraforming Mars, Castles of Burgundy, Bora Bora, Caverna, The Quest for El Dorado, Five Tribes

&amp;#x200B;

**Favorite designers:**

Stefan Feld, Bruno Cathala, Uwe Rosenberg, Reiner Knizia

&amp;#x200B;

**Most played games:**

The Quest for El Dorado, Splendor, Jaipur, Lost Cities, TtR Europe (w/ Europa 1912 expansion), and Five Tribes probably in that order

&amp;#x200B;

**Newest:**

Concordia Venus Standalone, Clank! (w/ Sunken Treasures expansion)

&amp;#x200B;

**Hidden gems/Diamonds in the rough:**

Kana Gawa and La Isla. Both these games don't rate highly on BGG but I've found them to be fantastic filler games that can be played in 30-45 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Not pictured:**

Concordia Venus (on its way)

&amp;#x200B;

**Shelf of Shame:**

I'm yet to play The Betrayal at House on the Hill; I've only played both Pandemic and Scythe only a couple of times each so far only on solo mode. I need to get these to the table and start teaching my group.

&amp;#x200B;

**Wanted games:**

Great Western Trail, Clans of Caledonia, Architects of West Kingdom, Brass (Lancashire or Birmingham), Troyes, Viticulture EE, Feast for Odin, Tigris and Euphrates, Spirit Island

&amp;#x200B;

**How did you acquire your games?**

Bought most of them from Amazon/Target during holiday sales or during some special promotion.

&amp;#x200B;

Some were bought used/NIS via Craigslist/FB marketplace/OfferUp.

\- I bought SmallWorld and Betryal on the Hill for $5 each via OfferUp. It was played by the seller maybe, 2-3 times each.

\- I bought Caverna via FB marketplace for $35 from someone who only took off the shrink and did not even punch out the components. The box had a minor damage in one corner but it was pristine otherwise. She had Agricola and her group had no interest in Caverna. Her loss, my gain.

\- I got TtR USA for $10 via Craiglist. Again, it looked like the game was only played 2-3 times. The box had a minor damage (a small punchthrough hole in the bottom). Patched it up without any issues.

&amp;#x200B;

I frequent r/Boardgamedeals and BGG 'Hot Deals' forum almost on a daily basis to see if there are any sales on the games that I've been interested in buying.

&amp;#x200B;

**Most expensive games:**

Like I mentioned before, I bought most of my games when they were on sale. Scythe ($40 at Amazon US w/ holiday promo for using an Amex card) and Concordia Venus standalone ($43 at Amazon UK) are the most expensive games in my collection

I teach college composition and tend to enjoy using games during the first week as a way to introduce some basic concepts but also to get students to socialize. 

I've had limited success with Werewolf in the past because it involves a higher language barrier that some students who do not natively speak English struggle with. 2R1B seems to be much less language reliant in terms of game concepts, so it is an attractive alternative. 

I hear a lot of good things about Two Rooms and a Boom, but I'm wondering: would Print and Play be fine? What comes in the set that you can buy online? Could I even make this game with a deck of 52 cards? 

I would love to get some feedback on the game, things to watch out for, and what would be best.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had limited success with Werewolf in the past because it involves a higher language barrier that some students who do not natively speak English struggle with. 2R1B seems to be much less language reliant in terms of game concepts, so it is an attractive alternative. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hear a lot of good things about Two Rooms and a Boom, but I&amp;#39;m wondering: would Print and Play be fine? What comes in the set that you can buy online? Could I even make this game with a deck of 52 cards? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to get some feedback on the game, things to watch out for, and what would be best. Print and Play is fine, and I have no issue buying the set on Amazon (except that I need to act within 6~ hours to get it by Wednesday when I need it).&lt;/p&gt;

941,,boardgames,"I sat at the airport and started thinking about board games at a very high level layer of abstraction and realized something interesting. Figured this might provoke some discussion - or comments that NO you are wrong. I may be! 

**So:**

If a game is entirely deterministic (no randomness, no hidden information, no player interaction (which can be considered hidden information)) then every game becomes 'solved' in a way and the entire playing of the game becomes learning a game to the level of that solved state. Best games make this discovery process very long, to the level where reaching it seems humanly impossible.

Games become 'broken' if that solved state guarantees a victory. Tic Tac Toe (which introduces player interaction, but is still primarily deterministic) isn't a broken game, but it's a solved one, for example. 

The more you introduce randomness (including modularity and shuffled decks) and hidden information to the game, the more you increase breadth of the game, but actually reduce depth. It's not that depth would be unreachable, it's just that it becomes strategically difficult to plan for - outside luck. So it stays in most plays at risk management level rather than long term planning. 

It's not bad though as some may lead you to believe. Good thing about hidden information, player interaction and randomness is that they also increase replayability of the game, especially in games where the core model isn't deep enough. This can give a game legs for years despite shallow depth and opens it up more for gateway and mass market popularity as well. Randomness also softens other faces of randomness, including player interaction.

Of course it is about balance in the end. Randomness, player interaction and hidden information can also lower the median depth of the game to a level where replayability seems less valuable and game rarely sees repeat plays. But too little of it could mean game is unattractive to most gamers. 

Last but not least, EVERY game is technically solvable to the level where ONLY randomness (hidden information, including player interaction) decides the winner. Trick is to hide it long enough or deep enough to either survive civilizations like Chess, or make wide scale impact enough that it takes years (such as with many popular games, like Scythe etc.) to be discovered and players to become bored with the breadth and depth they've explored.

945,,boardgames,"                I am a main boardgame owner in our group and I always read the rules, watch some videos  and explain the rules to my gaming group.

                The problem is that my fiancé often keeps watching the video with me and when I try explain the rules she keeps interrupting and gives the additions on the things I have prepared as next sentence or couple sentences down the line. Sometimes she even shouts from the kitchen a rule I ""missed"" but I was going to talk about it in a second.

                I am coming from the reasoning that when someone explains me the rules for more complicated game, I want to follow one person because it's annoying when someone just jumps into sentence with the additional rule.

                When I let her know that I am trying to explain the rules and to please stop interrupting, she usually ignores this request and when I do it second time she just gets angry and often after the game night she lets me know I was disrespectful and rude.

## Footnotes
- `#hmm` means that something about the project seems a little off. Buyer beware kinda thing.
- `#lolwut` is reserved for projects that seem like copycat games or campaigns put together with little thought. Check 'em out for amusement.
- `#take` tags are for projects that have been restarted for some reason, with the number indicating what iteration we're currently on.
- Did I miss something? Particularly something **new in the last 7 days** or **ending in the next 7 days**? Let me know in the comments and I'll add it in.

## Help Keep This Running
These lists take time and money to put together. Not a lot, but a little. If you enjoy them, maybe [toss me a buck](https://www.paypal.me/Zelbinian/1) now and then. 50% of after-expenses costs will be forwarded along to the [Jack Vasel Memorial Fund](http://www.jackvasel.org/).

[Signing up for a free AirTable account](https://airtable.com/invite/r/wJL1rj8U) via my referral link can help, too. Plus, it's swell!

&lt;p&gt;This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter board game projects that are either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;newly posted in the past 7 days&lt;/strong&gt;, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ending in the next 7 days (starting Jun 24)&lt;/strong&gt; and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, &lt;strong&gt;no need to ask.&lt;/strong&gt; (The occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between midnight and noon PST.&lt;/p&gt;

Imagine you are a minion, and you have a single werewolf to protect from being lynched. 
What I like to do in situations like this is to claim Seer, and tell everyone you viewed their card and they are a Tanner (not a town role - tanner). This will mean that town isn't likely to believe you are a minion, but they will still avoid lynching the WW so as to not give them the win.
Now, a smart werewolf will deduce your role and understand your angle, so they will start acting suspicious to further your plan. However, if your teammate doesn't catch your drift, no worries! You can just start acting suspicious yourself, and get lynched, but because you are but a humble minion your team will still win.

me (Mateusz) and my friend Konrad are 2 software developers from Poland. Each of us already has a published book and now we want to share some knowledge with fun games.

The idea is simple: remember all the original 151 Pokemon names? How about playing a game that lets you remember something useful: like what technologies are beneficial to learn to be a better Developer. 
I'm working on a more general IT related game ""IT Startup"" and Konrad is creating something more programming oriented (.NET ecosystem edtion) ""OutOfMemory!"".

We are looking for feedback and want to show you our Print&amp;Play prototypes.
They can be downloaded from this blogpost: http://tooslowexception.com/outofmemory-and-it-startup-card-game-prototypes-available/

One of the games (""IT Startup"") is already published in Poland (the polish version was successfully crowdfunded and sold to this day over 3k copies) so we already have some publishing know how and want to go global next year. 
If you are interested in IT related games it would be great if you give our Print &amp; Play prototypes a try. Only honest feedback can help us make better games.

Have fun and take care,

968,,boardgames,"My wife and I picked up the game from a local store. It was beautiful, we love co-op, we love videogames, we love RPG mechanics, what was there not to be stoked about?! We watched the tutorial video, set up the most basic scenario, started leveling up. It was super fun!

... Until it wasn't anymore. Suddenly we found a monster that did 3 reflect damage as our second fight, thank the game gods we could camp him to death from inside the city. But after that things became more manageable, it was lovely exploring and getting gear, we had a lot of fun!

... Until we weren't. Because the objective was to get a ton of ore, and we would have needed to go buckwild leveling up our caravans to even get close to winning. We were doomed from turn 4 or so.

So we set up a story. Tried to plan out a bit better. I went hard healer, she went damage and worker wild. It was a ton of fun, tromping over the map, working together to finish quests!

... Until it wasn't. A monster popped up with 3 range and WAY more than enough damage to wipe us both out in a single attack. I'd been upping my HP and healing alternately, and I STILL was 1-shot-kill-able. I literally would have had to put every point into health from square one to tank even a single attack, and then I'd have been useless for everything else but that. And that's not including abilities.

We waited for game night. 4 people SURELY would be more balanced, right? My wife went full tank, I went full healer, one of our friends went damage and the other was god of workers.

... Following the rules of setup, the FIRST monster did 5 reflect damage, and did more than enough damage per attack to kill 1 if not 2 people. So that was a hard reset.

We cheated. Took the points for leveling up to the starting xp levels as well as the starting boosts. Started the enemies at level 1 instead of 5. And you know what? The game was really, super fun! We played around, joked, everyone got to do what they loved doing most, it was a fantastic time!

... Until it wasn't. The boss spawned. We had been leveling up a lot, had really solid gear. We were pretty speciallized, so we didn't run into the same problems as before where nobody had enough damage to justify hitting a reflect, or enough up to take even a single hit. But the boss spawned with an ability called 'Whirlwind' (random chance to get that...) Which deals half his attack to all nearby allies of the main target.

Now, the TANK had 20 hp, and the boss had 16 FRELLING ATTACK. So the tank barely survived. Whirlwind, however, team wiped the rest of us, none of us having specced into health enough to suddenly eat 8 damage, not when you factored in all the poison and fire he was making appear everywhere as well, when the game had taught us the gospel of ""specialize, specialize, specialize!"" So we IMMEDEATELY, without any chance to react or have any warning, the first turn the boss appeared, in spite of the fact we cheated to be massively overleveled for where the game SAID we should be, lost in a single attack when he killed all 3 of us.

That wasn't fun. And it didn't feel like we'd planned poorly, or like we had been out strategied or like there was a single damn thing we could do about it. We died, it felt like, because ""F*ck you"", and there was no reason any other outcome should have been expected.

In my experiance, City of Kings is beautiful, clever, wild, fantastic, and a pure joy to play, especilly with friends when you each get to play the way you all want to play. The problem is when the game abruptly, and without warning, decides that the fun is over, and if you aren't positioned like x or specd out like y or have at least a in b stat, you lose now. Thanks for playing, jerkwad.

Our worker player felt AWFUL because once the boss spawned, she couldn't do much, and ended up being one of the ones who died. The game directly punished her for doing what it claimed she should have been more than free to do, to play her hero the way she deemed most enjoyable.

I don't know when we'll be playing again. If we even will. But I know I'll WANT to. I'll remember the good times. Roaming the board with friends, leveling up, beating monsters and completing quests. But I'll always remember ""this guy does 16 damage to the tank, and 8 damage to everyone else. Then he spawns fire and poison everywhere."" ""So... We lose then?"" ""...Yea. I guess. Huh. That sucks.""

The game is incredibly fun. Until it isn't.

&lt;p&gt;... Until we weren&amp;#39;t. Because the objective was to get a ton of ore, and we would have needed to go buckwild leveling up our caravans to even get close to winning. We were doomed from turn 4 or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we set up a story. Tried to plan out a bit better. I went hard healer, she went damage and worker wild. It was a ton of fun, tromping over the map, working together to finish quests!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... Until it wasn&amp;#39;t. A monster popped up with 3 range and WAY more than enough damage to wipe us both out in a single attack. I&amp;#39;d been upping my HP and healing alternately, and I STILL was 1-shot-kill-able. I literally would have had to put every point into health from square one to tank even a single attack, and then I&amp;#39;d have been useless for everything else but that. And that&amp;#39;s not including abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We waited for game night. 4 people SURELY would be more balanced, right? My wife went full tank, I went full healer, one of our friends went damage and the other was god of workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... Following the rules of setup, the FIRST monster did 5 reflect damage, and did more than enough damage per attack to kill 1 if not 2 people. So that was a hard reset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cheated. Took the points for leveling up to the starting xp levels as well as the starting boosts. Started the enemies at level 1 instead of 5. And you know what? The game was really, super fun! We played around, joked, everyone got to do what they loved doing most, it was a fantastic time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... Until it wasn&amp;#39;t. The boss spawned. We had been leveling up a lot, had really solid gear. We were pretty speciallized, so we didn&amp;#39;t run into the same problems as before where nobody had enough damage to justify hitting a reflect, or enough up to take even a single hit. But the boss spawned with an ability called &amp;#39;Whirlwind&amp;#39; (random chance to get that...) Which deals half his attack to all nearby allies of the main target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the TANK had 20 hp, and the boss had 16 FRELLING ATTACK. So the tank barely survived. Whirlwind, however, team wiped the rest of us, none of us having specced into health enough to suddenly eat 8 damage, not when you factored in all the poison and fire he was making appear everywhere as well, when the game had taught us the gospel of &amp;quot;specialize, specialize, specialize!&amp;quot; So we IMMEDEATELY, without any chance to react or have any warning, the first turn the boss appeared, in spite of the fact we cheated to be massively overleveled for where the game SAID we should be, lost in a single attack when he killed all 3 of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That wasn&amp;#39;t fun. And it didn&amp;#39;t feel like we&amp;#39;d planned poorly, or like we had been out strategied or like there was a single damn thing we could do about it. We died, it felt like, because &amp;quot;F*ck you&amp;quot;, and there was no reason any other outcome should have been expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experiance, City of Kings is beautiful, clever, wild, fantastic, and a pure joy to play, especilly with friends when you each get to play the way you all want to play. The problem is when the game abruptly, and without warning, decides that the fun is over, and if you aren&amp;#39;t positioned like x or specd out like y or have at least a in b stat, you lose now. Thanks for playing, jerkwad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our worker player felt AWFUL because once the boss spawned, she couldn&amp;#39;t do much, and ended up being one of the ones who died. The game directly punished her for doing what it claimed she should have been more than free to do, to play her hero the way she deemed most enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know when we&amp;#39;ll be playing again. If we even will. But I know I&amp;#39;ll WANT to. I&amp;#39;ll remember the good times. Roaming the board with friends, leveling up, beating monsters and completing quests. But I&amp;#39;ll always remember &amp;quot;this guy does 16 damage to the tank, and 8 damage to everyone else. Then he spawns fire and poison everywhere.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;So... We lose then?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;...Yea. I guess. Huh. That sucks.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is incredibly fun. Until it isn&amp;#39;t. And I hate that I have to say that.&lt;/p&gt;

Got the standard version of Dinosaur Island on a whim the other day and was disappointed with the uniform and boring plastic dinosaur meeples, as well as the flimsy cardboard hexagons for the scientists.

I considered getting those upgrade packs for lots of monies or get something off etsy. Took a gamble and got tiny “rubber eraser” dinosaurs from amazon. They cost like ten bucks for 150(!) of them, in different models and colors. Turns out they fit the game’s paddocks perfectly and, being rubber, feel perfect as well. I was worried they’d just fall apart, but they’re quite sturdy!

Now I assume that since those are rubber erasers, they will disintegrate over time. We’ll see. But for now I recommend this as a great and dirt cheap way to upgrade your Dinosaur Island.

984,,boardgames,"Hello Ticket To Ride fans!

I am pleased to announce the launch of **Ticket To Ride Score Calculator app for Android**!

The app allows you to scan your Ticket To Ride game board using your **phone's camera** to calculate the game scores automatically!

Ticket To Ride is a great board game, but counting the final score at the end can be so annoying sometimes.There's the score marker, but more often than not, someone will forget to move it during the game and you end up counting the scores manually.

With this app you can simply take a picture of the game board using your phone's camera and it will automatically recognize player trains and calculate the scores for you!

Here’s the app in Android Play Store: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buslovsky....](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buslovsky.ttrsc) .
You can find additional information and support the project on the website: [http://serg.buslovsky.com/ttrsc/](http://serg.buslovsky.com/ttrsc/) .
And a video overview here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m\_M\_zGK87j0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_M_zGK87j0) .

Support for iOS(Apple) device is coming soon!

987,,boardgames,"Dear all

Im currently pondering to run a biweekly or monthly boardgame afternoon in my small town.

I have two possible locations that can inckude drinks and cake.

I would bring my own small collection to get things rolling and invite everyone to bring their own stuff as well.

Did you ever organize something like that? How did it go, what did you miss?

How do I actually get people to play? Do o break up groups that arrive? Do I out Singles into a waiting line till there is a Group for game? Should I Focus on drop-in games?
