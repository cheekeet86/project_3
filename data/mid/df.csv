0,Suggestions as to the identity of this horror game?,6,"So, a bit of backstory.

A few years ago, I had seen a person playing this game and had watched them do a nearly full playthrough of it. I had been fascinated by it at the time and searching for it ever since to no avail.

&amp;#x200B;

**Content Summary**

The game I'm looking for was a mobile horror/psychological horror game, with a sort of alternate reality plot.

 The art style of the game was very reminiscent of games like My Lovely Daughter and Sally Face, the like, a lot of line shading and detailed stylistic choices. Most of the character designs were animal-based, especially with their heads. Most memorable would be a deer/elk/caribou-looking creature in a black cape and an overly detailed horse head on a rather humanoid, clothed body.

There was a rather convoluted plot, but well-written. The core of it from what I can remember was your being in some form of whimsical wintery fantasy underworld, guarded by some form of powerful animal protectors. 

I know a number of key events, too. There was a plot line where you had to give four dead babies to a horse in a river in order to fuse their souls into a light source for a dark brick hall area, after which the horse drowns and the river turns to blood.

There's a portion where you have to follow the voice of a singing woman, who then turns horrific and then kills you.

Finally, the ending of the game is hidden in the official guide, where you find a year, then get four symbols, then you unlock the end in the actual game itself.

I believe the name began with a P.

Can anyone help me find out what this game is called or where I can find it?"

It was a look down from above game, when you would move your character in a direction the screen would have to reload so if you had crappy service other real people could kill you fast haha. They had towns randomly placed on the map and once in a town you could talk to all the other real people playing the game. Like i said I remeber it being black and white looking down from above on your character."

I'm conducting a survey which is part of a research on mobile gaming market. The aim of the study is to investigate the future of the market and its attractiveness. Framework used for creating the survey is the Motivation Scale for Sport Consumption, which has been created for traditional sports and later on has been adapted to online sports as well (Trail &amp; James, 2001). 

The survey will take up to 5 minutes to answer. In the survey you may find statements that look similar to each other, this is part of the methodology ‚Äì don‚Äôt be scared :)

22,Does anyone know the name of this/these game(s)???,2,"I played these two apps years ago and they came in my mind and I wanted to play them again but I have absolutly no idea what there name is and I also can't find them in the Google Play Store. Maybe there are deleted after all these years. 

1. One game you had eggs of four different colors and you must swipe them to the correct color, of the for example yellow easter egg hit the blue one it was game over. The more correct color sets you get in one game the more coins you will get and with these coins you can upgrade your garden with chickens and other chickens sorts, you can buy toys plants for them and you will get bonuses of them.

2. Second game, it will be a medieval idle game. You started with a lumbermill (or some sort of wood gain), and with that you gain wood. With that wood you can upgrade the lumbermill and also buy a quarry (or some sort of stone gain). With the wood and stone you can upgrade the quarry, and buy a new thing/maker. You had a coal maker, gold mine/maker. You had different tabs in the game, first one the tab with all the buildings so the lumbermill quaryy mines etc., an other tab to upgrade heroes (you can upgrade them after ascention) an other tab for the upgrade tab the research tab so you can get new buildings new mines new technoligies. You also can asvance to next ages. Stone ages, iron/steel age, gold ages. You had millitary you can send away and you will get all these recoures from it, like wood stone gold, all these things you can get from the buildings. Above all these tabs you had a picture of your kingdom village town etc., the picture will update each time you will get a new sort of builing. You also had that the buildings, like a gold mine requires coal from the coal mine and because of that each time you will upgrade your gold mine the coal producting will decrease because the gold mine requires more coal recourse."

For those of you who don't know what it was. Mercenary Kitties was like Tiny Troopers or whatever that game was called except with cats and loads of gore. If I remember correctly it was a Adult Swim game or something. But I would often get attached to my cats and be sad when they died and be replaced with a new one. There was even a graveyard I think. All-round it was good dumb fun.

Edit: Forgot to mention this was around when the first few Iphones were made I forget which one I had at the time its been so long."
28,An old mobile game from years back,1,"Hey, so, I remember there being this somewhat older mobile game, an RPG of sorts, in which you would control a small team of little chibi units to fight waves of enemies. 

You'd drag them to move them around the map and tap on enemies to have the selected hero attack them. Despite its simplicity, the game itself really ramped up on difficulty as it went on, emphasizing a need to properly micromanage your heroes' positions and skills, as well as prioritizing specific enemies when they did appear.

You'd start off with a priestess and a knight and soon come across a thief and a mage as well. Of course, you'd eventually come across other classes such as a monk and a berserker, if memory serves.

I don't remember what the name of it is, however, and I've had no luck on finding it, so I was wondering if any of you might know what I am talking about?"
29,I need new games!,1,"Hi there! I play (and absolutely adore) Tiny Monsters and AFK Arena. The problem is that I'm at a stage where I can't really do a lot in either of them, I'm pretty stuck you could say. So I need some other games to keep my hands busy. 
I'm on android, but I've got an old iPad on my hands. Other games I've enjoyed in the past (but aren't in the store anymore) are ocean tower and mermaid world. I also love haypi monsters but you can't connect anymore and the staff apparently abandoned it long ago.... I also played stuff like Dragon Story and Dragon Vale, but I started to appreciate the art of Tiny Monsters a lot more...

If someone bothered to read all this and has something in mind that I could enjoy I'd appreciate it!"

44,"Old Games like FF Mobius, Brave Frontier, etc. gives too much, lowering difficulty",2,"What I mean by this is if these are old enough, they give new players better stuff than if you were to get the game when it first came out. For example, FF Mobius, when I played the game again, it offered a starter pack for 3 summoning tickets (pretty cheap). What I got was a job that raised my attack stat up to around 200 to 800. It also gave me 5 rank 5 abilities. This removes any difficulties I have in the beginning levels. For brave frontier or similar games, I was given so many free gems for things, like apologizes for errors, or random events I wasn't even there for. This allowed me to summon a bunch of people/monsters, and not only that, I always got high level monsters. 

Sometimes if I use a already existing account at low rank/level, the same thing happens. Stuff like this lowers the fun a bit or a lot depending on the game. A want a little struggle. Does anyone else think the same thing?"

107,"Rant about mobile game companies, especially playgendary",11,"Tomb of the mask. A very popular mobile game that was advertised a lot. Made by playgendary.

When you open the game, the first thing they show you is a three day trial for their subscription.
It removes ads, gives you some coins, gives you unlimited energy(keep playing it as long as you want without paying extra) and it gives you 4 skins.

Well, guess how much the subscription is after the trial.

8.49‚Ç¨ PER WEEK!

THAT'S OVER 440‚Ç¨ A YEAR!

Fucking hell. And with the free trial they're clearly intending this.

1. Kid sees trial and asks mom to use her credit card for it
   
2. Kid plays it maybe for a week or two, then forgets about it, subscription keeps going.

3. Profit

That's fucking shady. 440‚Ç¨ per year is NOT a reasonable price for some extra things in a free game. Yes, they do offer cheaper plans(for example a one year plan for 104‚Ç¨, but it doesn't have a free trial and they barely advertise it. You really have to look for it)

The game has over 50 million downloads. If even a small percentage of those forgot a subscription, they still make a shit ton of money

On top of that they also have ads, powerups, skins, lootboxes, in-game currency and an energy counter that lets you keep playing if you pay. 

Feel free to spread the message, I think we need to bring more attention to this. Other companies do this too."

I hate FPS. I am terrible at any sort of combat in games. For example, I started playing Breath of the Wild on my friend's switch and I LOVED the environment, the puzzle games in the temples, and the serenity of exploration but I just am not coordinated enough (or attention span enough) to fight bad guys all the time or to fight bosses. 

But I get bored with games like Godus, where the gameplay never changes. So instead of combat I think I'd like puzzles or mini games. 

Westland Suvival was great until...the developers decided to update silly little side things instead of opening up the world for further exploration. 

Solely survival-based games stress me out too much. 

I'm really looking for a beautiful world that I can explore at my leisure, choose to do quests or not, play puzzles, and fighting/combat isn't super prevalent. 

I know this all is super specific but can anyone recommend me something? Thank you!"

basically, I'm looking for an AFK game where a hero or a town moves independently. Like the hero takes on quests or something and when you log in, you see a summary of whats been done or the results of growth. 

I guess what I'm going for is like a world ""moving"" on its own with me nudging it along from time to time with input. Would also be cool if it had an option for active play if I wanted.

Any recommendations would be appreciated. Been looking around but nothing has been right so far. :("

And once the user accumulation is achieved, how to increase the retention rate? and eventually lead them towards consumption are the most important factors to be considered in game operation. With the increasing cost per user and the low willingness of users to pay, game operators have to find out the users' needs, propose targeted and feasible products, and promote the products in order to achieve the purpose of attracting users, improving retention rate and conversion rates.

Here are several thoughts on the monetization of mobile game traffic.

&amp;#x200B;

**Starting with product optimization.**

A successful game must first be a good game with high quality and theme because players will judge the game from their experience. Start from the game itself, whether it has a descent  graphic effect and playability to attract users to spend time and money for participating.  Therefore, within the participation, how to fulfill players' needs and lead them to pay for the game is the core subject for operation team to improve and optimize.  The product is the foundation, as long as the contents are perfect, the players will come naturally.

&amp;#x200B;

**Gain Traffic from diversified platforms.**

Normally, there are several ways to obtain traffic for a game: App Store, Mobile pre-installed, mobile game media and social media. However, with the rapid development of the mobile internet, user acquisition has become more and more extensive, and numerous of distribution channels have emerged. There is no doubt that games' traffic acquisition should be more diversified and the key is to find where the target users are located.

&amp;#x200B;

**Utilize Data as a reference for the monetization.**

In the filed of mobile games, data is the most significant factors. The core of the industry has become targeting users precisely, further exploring user value and reducing marketing costs through data. The reason is that data can play an important role in guiding and analyzing all aspects of game product's addition, activation, retention, conversion, traffic, promotion, user management, revenue, and new version iteration. With the power of big data, the analysis of player behavior can be more accurate. thereby effectively increasing product revenue and extending product life-cycle.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lean Operations to assist monetization.**

The competition among the mobile game industry is becoming fierce. It is not enough to be successful only with a good product. The success of a game is to satisfy the entertainment needs of the players while allowing the game company to make profits and to obtain traffics simultaneously. The key is the lean operation, and the operation has very clear goals: Acquire tremendous amount of users, improve users' activity, generate consumption and seek a suitable profiting model."

The way the game is drawn looks pretty realistic, unlike CoC btw."
254,Looking for a new game,3,"I'm trying to find a good mobile game to try. Not too big on war games or things like those, more of a relaxing game person. It's better if it's a challenge since I pick up on patterns really easily and tend to get bored with games very quick.

Games like Brick Breaking or Bubble Popping, are fun but easy to get bored with and I already have a book version of Sudoku so I don't want any apps for it. Games similar to candy crush type apps aren't my thing either. I'm not into the coloring apps because most apps are click by numbers.

I was REALLY enjoying TerraGenesis but I already figured out how to breeze through it so it lost it's fun. And Plague Inc is an oldie but a goodie but again, the problem of predictability. I liked that piano rhythm game but the screen moving makes me nauseous so I can't play it or any other game like that for long.

Games that *penalize* for being away/only reward for CONSTANT game play aren't ideal since I mostly game in between customers at work (Lyft -parking lot breaks, never while driving).

Does anyone have any ideas? Appreciate all input and suggestions."

[Some Jumpy J Gameplay](https://reddit.com/link/b6h0f7/video/9bg5uvzz2uo21/player)

Hey there!

I'm part of okii Games, a tiny team of game devs from Germany. We're about to release a small arcade game called ""Jumpy J"". The objective is to keep the character inside the screen whilst hitting the green platforms to gain points.

We tried a new controller concept: Let's call it the ""two thumbs controller"". You use two fingers to control a ""paddle"" which can interact with the character.  As far as we know: that's NEW. As long as both of your fingers are touching the screen the paddle will be solid. If you hit multiple platforms end to end without touching one more than once you can get combo points, which scale your points gained exponentially. You can beat your own high score or compare yourself on a global leaderboard (or at least you should eventually be able to).

If you've lost a game but got a life, either by ""beating"" a level or getting at least 50 points, you can continue by watching an ad. A level contains a total of 10 platforms, which are with a little bit of practice perfectly reachable. We're counting your in-game time and after a margin of 5 minutes, you need to watch an ad, either to start a new game or to continue your current game. Alternatively, you could just wait 5 minutes and you'll be fine, too.

Jumpy J aims to be a cheerful game with a light-hearted art style. We've worked on it for several months and would be stoked about your feedback!

Greetings

You can't deny Clash Royale is on the rise. They have so many tournaments lined up this year. World Cyber Games 2019 in Xi'an is one to definitely look out for. They haven't announced the prize pools yet, but I am hoping to see some of these top players compete on the big stage. Personally, I wanna see Ming against Surgical Goblin. Goblin is unlike any player I have ever seen, and Ming is a mastermind.

1. Are  there any obvious omissions among the better known games in the market  in terms of reviews/gameplay that people want to see but there is a  shortage of? (E.g. I am guessing CoC and the like are done to death)
2. Are there any new games that are an absolute must for showcasing/reviewing?
3. Are there any games that it is common consensus to stay away from?

372,Looking for the least pay to win game like Heroes Charge,3,"2 years ago i've been playing heroes charge for quite some time and had that monthly 5 euro subscription thing. I thought that it gave quite a bit of value and was an acceptable monetization for the game compared to other mobile games. After a year of playing i got to a point where i couldn't progress in the campaign or the arena without buying those fucking expensive pay2win heroes. So i got bored and quit.

Now I'm looking for a game of the same genre. I know there are dozens of clones, but i don't know if this genre has an own name. When looking for alternatives i saw Soul hunters and Portal Quest suggested and looked at the reviews of them in the play store. As i expected about half the reviews complained about pay2win. So I'm a little hesitant about starting to play one of those two games. 

It would be nice if you could show me the least pay2win game of that kind (or non pay2win if there even is such a thing). As i don't actually like playing on the small smartphone screen for a long time I'll be probably using bluestacks and play it on my second screen. And since I'm mostly playing on pc it would also be fine if such a game was on steam or a browsergame (are those still a thing?)."

397,Spelling Go! A unique spelling bee word puzzle game to improve your English vocabulary,1,"Hello all,

When I was a small child, I used to learn by heart spelling of different words by writing them multiple times. But it was not fun. I wanted to make learning different words some what fun for children. So I decided to work on ""Spelling Go!"" game which I am launching on Google Playstore and Apple appstore on 1st Feb 2019.

I wanted children to learn different word in a way that excite them or at least challenge them to to learn more and more. And not a boring repetitive process of writing them multiple times on a piece of paper. This I think what ""Spelling Go!"" accomplishes. In this spelling bee word puzzle game, you are presented with scattered letters on a grid. You need to guess the word that can be formed by those scattered letters. But this game is not just guessing the word. You also need to connect all the letters in a single path, line, connection or flow which starts from the first letter, goes through all the letters and then end at the last letter of the word. And the challenge does not end here. You also need to cover all the squares on the grid. No squares can be left empty. In this way, when you connect letters by letters in a sequential order, you are more likely to remember the spelling of the word. The following link is a gameplay video. What do you guys think?

You could pick up many weapons (pistol, assault rifle, smg, light machine gun, you could have them in dual form) including melee weapons like sword or katana and all of them were upgradable. They were dropped on the ground in crates and you could always see what type of weapon you were going to get.

430,Age of Strategy review (5/5 stars),4,"This review is on the mobile app game Age Of Strategy, if I had to give a brief description of the game I'd say it is like Fire Emblem and a 8 bit version of Sid Meier's Civilization. It's a free game and is easy to get the hang of if your aren't the biggest into the games listed above. The game is very well done and the developer is quite active and is good about responding to emails and is open to suggestions to make the game better. The game itself goes into depth, from its large selection of units to its many upgrades that add content to the game. you can build buildings (from archery ranges, to castles) and research technologys to better your units in game. The upgrades themselves cost gems to get,but you can get them multiple ways, like donating to the developers for example. You don't have to do that, the game includes tons of campaigns that have a lot of maps and you can earn more gems then you will ever need for the game. The game also includes a multiplayer function online and local or you can play against bots, the AI in the game is pretty good. You can choose to create a profile if you want (needed for online play). One of my personal favorite part of the game is the map created (also requires profile), but if you have a created map and think it would be good as a map in general for the game talk to the developers and as long as the map is balanced there is a possibility it can be added as a random map for non-campaign use, or it can be added as a map you can download along with many other maps made by members of the community, another thing I've noticed is if you make a map and it's put into the game itself the developers make sure to give you credit, I've even seen campaigns made by community members. Like all game it has its ups and downs, like multiplayer matches can last for days and if someone forgets about the game you started and doesn't take their turn well you are stuck from what I've heard, but I haven't had that problem yet. Sometime you will wait hours for your turn but you got to understand you could be playing with some on the other side of the world. Overall the game is well balanced among the units and is updated often, you can even go back and look through the version log (that will tell you all about the fixes and added content). Me personally would give the game a 10/10, but don't take my word for it check it out yourself, you might be surprised. well that's about it for my review on Age Of Strategy thanks for reading. Hope this helped "

I'll cut right to it. I used to play an old java game where you'd control battle units from a birds eye point of view, set in medieval times and had pixely RPG 2003 graphics.

I've really been searching high and low for it but I just can't remember anything about the name of the game at all. It was one of those games that seems normal and average on paper but when you played it, had something special about it. Really had a sort of romance with the game.

You would do all the usuals that concur in this genre, buy troops, deploy them, battle with them, command them etc. And if I remember correctly, your team was always blue and the enemy was red. You would work through a story mode and could unlock and deploy wyverns, dire wolves, catapults etc.

It was a .jar/.jad game and was in circulation amongst java sharing sites around 2008-2009.

I really appreciate any help in advance. I hope someone who remembers it can help! Cheers"
441,[RELEASE] [ANDROID] Crop Defence Released!,2," 

Me and a few friends starting writing an android game for a bit of fun and just last week we released to the play store. We think the game is pretty fun and a good way to waste some time on public transport! We would love to know what you think! We have a long list of backlogged ideas but if you have anything you would like to see we'd love to know!

Crop Defence is a game about creating a farm while defending the crops from birds, it's very casual and is definitely aimed towards a younger audience thanks to my bad art skills! There are in app purchases but I'd like to stress that the game is paced entirely around not making any purchases.

Please let us know what you think, the good and the bad!

445,[DEV] KingdomGame - Free online multiplayer strategy game,2,"Hello,

**First up, cards on the table, I'm one of the developers of this App / Game** \- it's my first (proper) Android App (although I released a bar billiards scorer a while back.. but does that count?) so thought I'd  post it up  here:

It's a free game - a  strategy game - originally written for mobiles just after the first  iPhone came out late 2007/2008 and ran for 9 years.  Over the last year  or so I've been rewriting it to work in a modern mobile / ui/ux friendly  way (so it  works via the web, tablet and mobile in much the same way).

The blurb for the game is as follows:

&gt;Fight in a world of a thousand kingdoms by ruling your own!  KingdomGame puts you in control as the absolute leader of a fledgling nation as it begins on it's path to riches, glory and political intrigue.  
Will  you be a warmonger, fighting with those kingdoms around you?  Will you be a trader producing goods for sale around the globe?  Or will  you be a spymaster, hidden in the shadows waiting to strike?

&amp;#x200B;

Some images from the game:

You can find the game here:

531,Class Recommendation in Taptap Heroes‚ÄîWarrior,0,"As a mobile hero-cultivation idle RPG game, Taptap Heroes has a variety of heroes. The upgrade of hero skills, the forge of equipment, the cooperation of different classes heroes, and various gameplays with a variety of ways make the battle changeable. In combat, players need to think about how to arrange the heroes of our team according to the attributes of the heroes to ensure victory. Obviously, the role of the hero is particularly important. This article mainly introduces the Warriors in Tapap Heroes. Due to version updates and the growth of heroes, we only introduce the heroes who can be promoted to 6 stars in each camp.

Alliance

Sir Conrad. Recommended index ‚òÖ ‚òÖ

Sir Conrad is a warrior, but the skill configuration is more like an assassin. The damage is good. The active skill can kill the enemy hero who has the least remaining hp. After upgrading to 6 stars, the hero improves his survivability due to the increase of passive skills. Defect is no recovery ability.

King Lionheart. Recommended index ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ

King Lionheart has excellent defense skills and some control ability. In terms of attributes, his HP is more prominent, so he is an excellent tank character. However, because of non-recovery ability and low control ability, he can only be considered as a moderate choice in all aspects.

Horde

Wolf Rider. Recommended index ‚òÖ ‚òÖ

Wolf Rider is a hero that focuses on defense and control, which is similar to King Lionheart. His damage ability is higher than King Lionheart. However, in terms of basic attributes, HP and defenses are significantly weaker than the latter.

Minotaur. Recommended index ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÜ

He has the highest basic armor value in the current version, and the recovery ability is also a BUG level in the early stage. He has good output as a Warrior. He could be a tank character who has damage and defense in the early stage. He will have a very amazing performance in PVP battle. The disadvantage is low HP and no control ability. He will die very fast when his enemy hero has an armor effect.

Abyss Lord. Recommended index ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÜ Abyss Lord has good defensive ability, stable recovery ability, high basic HP, but he has obvious shortcomings, like low damage and no obvious control ability. He is relatively mediocre overall.

Elf Grand. Recommended index ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÜ Grand has excellent basic attributes. His basic HP and defense are great. His active skills not only strength his defense, but also has group armor break effect. The only drawback is that there is no recovery ability. Tiger King. Recommended index ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÜ

Tiger King is a tank hero with general defense ability. Compared with other traditional tank heroes, he is better at abilities that cause continuous damage to enemies. The disadvantage is that skill trigger conditions are very high, which requires a specific lineup to unleash effect.

Undead

Wolnir. Recommended index ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ

Wolnir has the highest basic HP of all heroes. Three of the four basic skills have the ability to recover hp. The other skill is to increase the upper limit of HP. He was the first tank in the past. But as the version was updated, Wolnir's ability to recover becomes weak, and it also exposed its flaws in the tank position: the ability to deal damage and control.

Cursed one. Recommended index ‚òÖ ‚òÖ

As a warrior, Cursed One has excellent killing ability and certain passive break defense. However, due to lack of recovery and damage reduction, his defense is also fragile, so he obviously cannot be used as a tank.

Heaven &amp; Hell

Nameless King. Recommended index ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ

Although the Nameless king is a warrior, he is not only a tank. His damage performance is amazing. The skill system itself can be achieved. He knows how to cooperate with the hero of the crit to trigger the mark and deal explosive damage.

Monkey King. Recommended index ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ

Monkey King's defense attributes are not outstanding and has no traditional tank advantage in HP and defense, but his skill makes him a non-negligible existence. He is extremely threatening to the enemy in the back line. At the same time, because of his ability to counterattack and passive resurrection, he could act as both a tank and an output.

The shooting was interesting cause you had to tap at the enemy and you would shoot. The strategic thing about the game was that you had to plan your attacks and shoot at the enemy's that fired first or were the most dangerous. 

The weapons in the game consists of the main gun and pistol. The parts of the gun and pistol were customizable, with each part yeilding different stats. These parts were unlocked in crates. Another cool thing about the customization was that when you changed The part of the gun, the new piece would be of a different aesthetic. Like a different color and design. If you got all the parts to a specific design you could literally re-create the gun into something totally different. This was the same for the armor customization too. Each part had unique stats with different parts that could be equipped. I remember there was jump boots that could be equipped to make the character jump really high. 

If you have any idea of what this game is I'd like to know, thanks in advance! "

It had a punchy title and the letters in the title were used as different level of difficulty, each with their own perks. The game has lanes that you can swipe between. You usually have to dodge white blocks but in later difficulties there are green blocks, which you have to run into, and blue blocks, which depending on which side the arrow is pointing to, you have to avoid the block by switching lanes to that side. The game also had an incredible cyberpunk soundtrack. I wish i remmebered the titles. Please help me find this game. Thanks."

So, I am making a mobile gaming online forum for mobile gamers to talk and etc. I haven't really seen anything like this. There is NeoGaf but that's not really made for or targeted to Mobile gamers, so I decided to make one myself for fun because of my love for mobile games.

Anyways, I'm having issues trying to sort the site out. For example, most gaming forums have sections for PC and then Xbox and etc where you pick your platform and talk about the games for that certain platform, however with mobile gaming, that wouldn't work. Should I just make one big section like NeoGaf and let users use tags to talk about the game they are playing? If I made a section for each game for mobile, that would be a massive list and it would be hard to find the game you're looking for.

I was also thinking maybe sort it by gamemode types, like mobile RPG games and mobile FPS shooters and mobile sandbox games but this also seems a little confusing to me. What if there is a multi gamemode game, for example Fortnite mobile could be seen as a FPS shooter, battle royal, and a sandbox game because you can build inside of the game.

Please let me know what you guys think as this would help me a lot.

If I posted this in the wrong subreddit please do let me know and I'll move it.

Thank you!"

574,Idle with rich gameplay.,0,"Taptap heroes is a casual, strategic idle RPG mobile game, where players will be in the world of Mystia with the global players, upgrade heroes and create their own hero team. Easy idle gameplay does not need you to play all day and force you to speed money to get strong, which makes the game truly entertained rather than a burden.

Idle with rich gameplay.

As a casual idle mobile game, Taptap heroes is very rich in gameplay. With the regular idling mode, players can acquire equipment and upgrade levels. As the player level increases, the game will unlock guild, arena, expedition, planet trials, etc. Whether upgrading material acquisition or fighting with other players, or participating in the guild construction and growing up with friends from all over the world, players can meet different needs and experience loads of fun.

The most important thing is that all this does not require the players to ""spend tons of money."" One of the characteristics of the idle game is that even if you are offline, you can still receive experience and equipment. Players only need to open the game in their free time to collect offline idle loots to get a variety of resource materials. They can enjoy the game freely! At the same time, all the resources in the game can be obtained through normal game play, and it is not necessary to speed money but players can freely enjoy the game fun rather than a burden!

Meticulous combat power improvement

In Taptap heroes, players don't need much operation. What they really need to think about is how to build the strongest team. The rich character growth system requires players to ‚Äúpay attention‚Äù on how to maximally cultivate the heroes they really need instead of wasting resources.

In addition to the hero itself, there are many ways players can increase their combat power, such as the improvement of the overall attributes of Aura and the wonderful chemical reactions of various hero combinations. A reasonable lineup should have tank/output/heal, but in the Taptap heroes, it also allows you to develop more novel combinations, such as a violent combination with full of output, or tank and Cleric composed of the Great Wall.

Exquisite graphics, rich gameplays, and non-money spend are the charm of Taptap heroes, but its charm is not only that. If you want to enjoy pure game fun, make friends around the world, Taptap heroes will be best choice!"

618,Class Reviews in Taptap Heroes‚ÄîWarrior,1,"As a mobile hero-cultivation idle RPG game, Taptap Heroes has a variety of heroes. The upgrade of hero skills, the forge of equipment, the cooperation of different classes heroes, and various gameplays with a variety of ways make the battle changeable. In combat, players need to think about how to arrange the heroes of our team according to the attributes of the heroes to ensure victory. Obviously, the role of the hero is particularly important. This article mainly introduces the Warriors in Tapap Heroes. Due to version updates and the growth of heroes, we only introduce the heroes who can be promoted to 6 stars in each camp.

Alliance

Sir Conrad. Recommended index ‚òÖ ‚òÖ

Sir Conrad is a warrior, but the skill configuration is more like an assassin. The damage is good. The active skill can kill the enemy hero who has the least remaining hp. After upgrading to 6 stars, the hero improves his survivability due to the increase of passive skills. Defect is no recovery ability.

King Lionheart. Recommended index ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ

King Lionheart has excellent defense skills and some control ability. In terms of attributes, his HP is more prominent, so he is an excellent tank character. However, because of non-recovery ability and low control ability, he can only be considered as a moderate choice in all aspects.

Horde

Wolf Rider. Recommended index ‚òÖ ‚òÖ

Wolf Rider is a hero that focuses on defense and control, which is similar to King Lionheart. His damage ability is higher than King Lionheart. However, in terms of basic attributes, HP and defenses are significantly weaker than the latter.

Minotaur. Recommended index ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÜ

He has the highest basic armor value in the current version, and the recovery ability is also a BUG level in the early stage. He has good output as a Warrior. He could be a tank character who has damage and defense in the early stage. He will have a very amazing performance in PVP battle. The disadvantage is low HP and no control ability. He will die very fast when his enemy hero has an armor effect.

Abyss Lord. Recommended index ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÜ Abyss Lord has good defensive ability, stable recovery ability, high basic HP, but he has obvious shortcomings, like low damage and no obvious control ability. He is relatively mediocre overall.

Elf Grand. Recommended index ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÜ Grand has excellent basic attributes. His basic HP and defense are great. His active skills not only strength his defense, but also has group armor break effect. The only drawback is that there is no recovery ability. Tiger King. Recommended index ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÜ

Tiger King is a tank hero with general defense ability. Compared with other traditional tank heroes, he is better at abilities that cause continuous damage to enemies. The disadvantage is that skill trigger conditions are very high, which requires a specific lineup to unleash effect.

Undead

Wolnir. Recommended index ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ

Wolnir has the highest basic HP of all heroes. Three of the four basic skills have the ability to recover hp. The other skill is to increase the upper limit of HP. He was the first tank in the past. But as the version was updated, Wolnir's ability to recover becomes weak, and it also exposed its flaws in the tank position: the ability to deal damage and control.

Cursed one. Recommended index ‚òÖ ‚òÖ

As a warrior, Cursed One has excellent killing ability and certain passive break defense. However, due to lack of recovery and damage reduction, his defense is also fragile, so he obviously cannot be used as a tank.

Heaven &amp; Hell

Nameless King. Recommended index ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ

Although the Nameless king is a warrior, he is not only a tank. His damage performance is amazing. The skill system itself can be achieved. He knows how to cooperate with the hero of the crit to trigger the mark and deal explosive damage.

Monkey King. Recommended index ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ

Monkey King's defense attributes are not outstanding and has no traditional tank advantage in HP and defense, but his skill makes him a non-negligible existence. He is extremely threatening to the enemy in the back line. At the same time, because of his ability to counterattack and passive resurrection, he could act as both a tank and an output."

These puzzles are from today's daily challenge of Number Go! Can you solve these puzzle, each within 15 sec, by connecting all the numbers starting from 1 to the largest number in increasing order and cover all the grids by a single line or flow without overlapping?

If you like solving such puzzles, let me introduce my game ""Number Go!"" which I just recently launched for iOS and Android. Some features of the game:

1. It is a simple, addictive game that you can play at any time, while on your way to office/school on bus, in a car pool (of course not while driving :-)) or train. The gameplay is very minimalist and require only a single finger to play.
2. Quick to get into and get out of the game. You can play it while waiting at the airport, doctor's clinic, shopping line at the grocery store etc. where when needed you can simply get out of the game without effecting your gameplay or score.
3. I have tried to design the game in a way to minimize the battery consumption. This was very important for me because I really wanted the users to play game for long time without worrying about the battery life.
4. There are 5000+ unique puzzles. The design of the each puzzle pack is such that the difficulty level increases gradually. Once you unlock daily challenges, then you will also receive 5 unique challenging puzzles daily.
5. There are several achievements in the game which you can achieve once you complete certain tasks/challenges or level packs. There are also two leaderboards: one overall player ranking and the other is the daily challenge ranking. Using those leaderboards, you can compete against your friends and other people. The faster you complete a level, the higher score you get.

650,The Battle of Polytopia (Mobile),3,"Hey everyone! I wrote a post about a great mobile game my friends and I found called The Battle of Polytopia. [I would love for you to view the original post with all of it's media here](https://www.gameguider.gg/gameguider/blog/viewBlog/7), but if you want to stay right here, I will put the text below. Cheers!

&amp;nbsp;

***

&amp;nbsp;

I‚Äôve never been one to play games on my phone. I‚Äôll typically have one or two downloaded to kill some time while I‚Äôm away from home, but if I‚Äôm really trying to game, I‚Äôm definitely set up at my PC. This was true, until my friends and I downloaded The Battle of Polytopia. A 4X style of game (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate) Polytopia is similar to the Civilization series, but simplified to make it more approachable for those who are new to the genre. But don‚Äôt let that make you think that the game is any less fun; especially when you get a game going with a group of your friends, you will find yourself turning on your phone more often than your computer.

&amp;nbsp;

We stumbled upon Polytopia at a good time: I had just finished a game of Civ 5 and found myself overwhelmed by how long it had took. After a staggering 450 turns I had finally won the game. Unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt be excited about winning because I was too glad that it was just finally over. Which is disappointing because I‚Äôm a huge fan of the genre and I used to be a huge fan of the Civ series. As I played through my first game of Polytopia, I was refreshed by how they captured all of the fun that 4X genre can offer but managed to do it in a way that made Civilization 5 look like Quantum Physics.

&amp;nbsp;

The mechanics were very easy to pick up. There‚Äôs a small learning curve (as there is in almost every game) but while you are learning, you are still able to enjoy the process. Controlling your units, building up your cities, and battling your enemies is all extremely easy to navigate. Because of this simplified system, the 4 X‚Äôs (Exploring, Expanding, Exploiting, and Exterminating) are allowed to take the forefront and are not hidden behind a giant wall of scary buttons and levers. The graphics pair perfectly with this simplified system. The minimalist art design, bright colors and cute little characters combine to create a world worth conquering.

&amp;nbsp;
  
The aspect that absolutely took this game to the next level was the online play. While completely free to download and play offline (either against bots or with other people in the room), to play online, they do require you to spend $0.99 on one of the ‚Äútribes‚Äù in order to help them keep the servers running. If you have a group of friends who all like to play games together, this $0.99 is one of the cheapest ways to add a great multiplayer game to your repertoire. The online play is very well-tuned. Adding your friends and getting a game going is painless. The turn-based system gives you the freedom to not be stuck at your phone through the whole game and the quick turns help keep the game moving. Once you get the games going, they will quickly create some fierce competition for you and your friends to enjoy.

&amp;nbsp;

For a mobile game, Midjiwan absolutely captured the essence of what‚Äôs important. It's easy to navigate on the mobile platform. The controls are fluid and work consistently. It's approachable. Everyone from hardcore gamers to someone who isn't a gamer at all can join in on the fun. You can easily play with friends. Sometimes, the most fun that games can offer isn't in extensive gameplay, but just some fun and simple gameplay enjoyed with friends. Well done, Midjiwan. I‚Äôm excited to see what you all have in store next!"

654,A fair warning for new players: Hero Academy 2,1,"From what many of us members of the Official Discord Server can gather, the game is not going to receive future additions or even balance patches: **what you see know is what you are getting for, and nothing else**.

This is based on stuff that persisted for over three months: 

**. the** **completely lack of response from the devs to people calling the game ""dead""** (which is info you would never want to get spread and would immediately argue against if it where not the case, or at least state that the devs can't release the information regarding that yet, or at least say something, anything, instead of dead silence);

**.  the completely lack of balancing patches** or any meaningful response to it despite a lot of people - even top players - asking for it repeatedly (cards like the Boar and Overpopulate come to mind). 

**. no future expansion possibility even hinted** by the devs. The cards you can get here in the game so far are realistically the only cards you will get.

The above points make for a stale (or stable, if you want a more positive outlook on the matter) gameplay, since there isn't any factors that will push it to change. 

**If you don't care for that**, if you can have fun only with the cards that the game currently has and the card balance it has, and if you judge that fun can last long enough to warrant buying packs and stuff with real Money, than sure, go ahead. I just wanted to give a fair warning for those who enjoy a evolving game in terms of collection, strategy, mechanics and such. If you don't aim for that, like I said, **it should be reasonable to buy some stuff. Otherwise, you definitely are going to have a bad time if you do that, specially if you have a tight budget for games and entertainment**"

My friend was really bored at work and decided to create a game just for the sake of it. It was a really simple arcade, that he created in like 10 hours. He wasn't planning on doing anything with it, as he considered it a test of his capabilities.

1 year later, his friend remembered (for some odd reason) about the little experiment that my friend did, and proposed to finish it and publish in the Play Store (also as an experiment, to see how it all works).

As they started to finish the game, they basically grew to love it. So, instead of just finishing it, we've spend like three month developing it, creating new game modes, working on the design and how to make it really interesting and fun. The more we worked on it, the more we started to believe in it.

And this is how we came here. We would really appreciate if you would check on our little (but super interesting!) game.

It was like clash of clans in the sense that you trained troops and leveled them up. However how many you sent out depended on the boats you had. I think there were also several different hero troops you could recruit. 

A big difference was that instead of attacking your base for pvp, you would take over Outposts. Then try to defend those.

I remember the art being pretty simple but very colorful and clean. If anyone can help thanks. I know that describes a lot of games nowadays.

While the vast majority of mobile apps are throwaway copycat cash grabs, there are a few standouts. But even those almost always fail to provide any recognition for the great people that made the game possible.

Why do mobile apps (games, in particular) refuse to have the traditional ""credits"" listings that all films and AAA games must have?

This is not a spam ad for the game at all, but ""Almost a Hero"" is the cookie cutter ""clicker"" game that lead me to ask. Not only is the voice cast a bit unique and better than most, but I recognize one of the voices and I have absolutely no way to determine who it is... "

I've played a couple things like dungeon quest and I really enjoyed it but the development¬†seems to have stagnated. I also enjoy idle incrimentals with good thoughtful progression choices.¬†

The biggest thing for me¬†these days is¬†that¬†I'd like a game where I can pick it up and play for 15 to 20 minutes and feel like I'm getting somewhere. I don't mind if there's content that will take a solid hour to complete occasionally but I like the mindless¬†grind of looking for gear and trying new abilities and synergies .

Anyone have a¬†suggestion? I don't mind paying upfront for something If the devopers and community is active.¬†

Was sitting in class and remembered a zombie game i played a couple of years ago but dont remember the name
Basic premise is that you build up a city (a street basically) you build shops and houses to house more people who come to your gate (left  part of the screen) and you can go out and gather supplies in your pick up with you standing in the back of it firing on normal zombies, radioactive zombies who explode once shot and brute zombies who got alot more health. It was animated in an almost cartonish style im pretty sure it was taken down from app store a while back but just wanted to know the name of it. Warm regards nubby"

793,New Political MMORPG,4,"Disclaimer: This is not an ad. I'm not the dev, just a player looking for other players. Not sure if this is the right place to post this, sorry if it isn't.

The game is called [Uprising: St Louis Community Community Edition](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ziquid.uslce). Technically this game is not new, it used to be very popular around about 8 years ago, and has recently come back to the Google Play store. It is also available on iOS for beta testers \(PM me for more info\).

It is basically a political game with parties and clans within those parties, where you work together with your clan/party to gain control of different hoods. You complete missions to gain influence \(exp\), loot and money. You can build your character as a breacher, a holder, a debater, or even an all rounder. The game has no ads and is free to play. You can make purchases in game but it's definitely not pay2win. It's definitely a very social game, and loads of fun. Just don't expect fancy graphics and sound effects! Give it a go, you might love it. It's very addictive.

If you want to, you can join my clan \- my referral code is F8MPZ. We're a very active and helpful clan, we can help you learn the game, and also boost your character. Even if you don't use my referral code, we'd just love to increase the player base!"

The game has beautiful, minimalistic graphics and is really addictive. 

The home run in the game is arcade mode. Arcade mode adds ‚Äúpower ups‚Äù to the game that help you navigate the maze and get out of tough situations. Hit the white power up to slow down the ground and help you catch back up. Hit the blue power up to multiply the number of balls you have to help you escape and make it easier to hit other power ups that come along. Hit the purple power up to ‚Äúphase"" through the floor for a short amount of time!

Tap your way to the top in this Idle RPG game with exciting battles, relaxing and rhythmic Celtic ‚Äì style music, and powerful sound effects! The innovative Idle Mode allows player to increase their power without endless grinding!

About‚ÄúTap Tap Heroes‚Äù: 

1.        IDLE systemÔºöYour heroes will continue to get fight even when you are not playing! They‚Äôll have obtained tons of new items that you can use to enhance your team and be ready for even fiercer battles!

2.        Tapping: Use the tapping feature to defeat waves of enemies‚Äô before taking on the boss!

3.        Countless Characters: Gather over 200 heroes from six different factions!  

4.        Guild Arena: Play with friends in the action-packed Guild Arena! Join a guild faction and work together to bring down guild-bosses! 



Gameplay Systems ‚Äì Easy to play &amp; Full of strategic depth 

‚ÄúTaptap Heroes‚Äù is an idle game that combines elements of different genres such as strategy, cards, and RPGs.

Compared to traditional tapping games, ‚ÄúTapTap Heroes‚Äù doesn‚Äôt require the player to spent hours grinding and instead focuses on strategy development. Heroes continue to fight and collect resources even when you‚Äôre not playing, putting the focus on resource management and hero development with the goal of crafting a powerful team.
There are ton of gameplay systems to construct your strategy around. The game features nearly 200 heroes spread across six factions, each with weaknesses and advantages against other factions. Certain faction compositions activate Auras which further boost certain hero attributes and benefit different strategies. With five different hero classes, and 100s of skills and equipment- the strategies and team compositions are endless!
But a powerful team needs enemies to fight and ‚ÄúTapTap Heroes‚Äù has plenty of challenges ahead...

Battle through the Campaign and defeat the crafty Freya before she can set her plans into motion. Compete with other players online in the Arena and take your rightful place on the Throne. Or, perhaps, if you‚Äôre in a cooperative mood, take up a Guild banner, and work with other players to bring down Raid Bosses and develop your Guild into Mystia‚Äôs finest! All this and more await you in ‚ÄúTapTap Heroes‚Äù!  


No P2W here! 

""Taptap Heroes"" was designed to not force players to make in-app purchases to succeed. Part of that is in the Idle Mode, where players can still get items to develop their team even when they aren‚Äôt playing. Additionally, a lot of the VIP features can be unlocked simply by leveling up your account. The biggest benefit to purchasing items from the store is for boosts to character development, but players who opt to take their time will still find themselves with a rich game experience!

Join the battle! Tap your way to the top in this Idle RPG game!
The game is currently available on the Google Play Store and will be available on iOS soon!

952,Suggestions as to the identity of this horror game?,6,"So, a bit of backstory.

A few years ago, I had seen a person playing this game and had watched them do a nearly full playthrough of it. I had been fascinated by it at the time and searching for it ever since to no avail.

&amp;#x200B;

**Content Summary**

The game I'm looking for was a mobile horror/psychological horror game, with a sort of alternate reality plot.

 The art style of the game was very reminiscent of games like My Lovely Daughter and Sally Face, the like, a lot of line shading and detailed stylistic choices. Most of the character designs were animal-based, especially with their heads. Most memorable would be a deer/elk/caribou-looking creature in a black cape and an overly detailed horse head on a rather humanoid, clothed body.

There was a rather convoluted plot, but well-written. The core of it from what I can remember was your being in some form of whimsical wintery fantasy underworld, guarded by some form of powerful animal protectors. 

I know a number of key events, too. There was a plot line where you had to give four dead babies to a horse in a river in order to fuse their souls into a light source for a dark brick hall area, after which the horse drowns and the river turns to blood.

There's a portion where you have to follow the voice of a singing woman, who then turns horrific and then kills you.

Finally, the ending of the game is hidden in the official guide, where you find a year, then get four symbols, then you unlock the end in the actual game itself.

I believe the name began with a P.

Can anyone help me find out what this game is called or where I can find it?"

I used to play these two games one had i believe mechs/robots and the other was mid evil I think, i say mid evil because i remeber having armour and a bow for my character from random mobs i would kill. Both of these games were black and white.
It was a look down from above game, when you would move your character in a direction the screen would have to reload so if you had crappy service other real people could kill you fast haha. They had towns randomly placed on the map and once in a town you could talk to all the other real people playing the game. Like i said I remeber it being black and white looking down from above on your character."

971,Mobile gaming attractiveness - survey,2,"Hey,

I'm conducting a survey which is part of a research on mobile gaming market. The aim of the study is to investigate the future of the market and its attractiveness. Framework used for creating the survey is the Motivation Scale for Sport Consumption, which has been created for traditional sports and later on has been adapted to online sports as well (Trail &amp; James, 2001). 

The survey will take up to 5 minutes to answer. In the survey you may find statements that look similar to each other, this is part of the methodology ‚Äì don‚Äôt be scared :)

Thank you!"

974,Does anyone know the name of this/these game(s)???,2,"I played these two apps years ago and they came in my mind and I wanted to play them again but I have absolutly no idea what there name is and I also can't find them in the Google Play Store. Maybe there are deleted after all these years. 

1. One game you had eggs of four different colors and you must swipe them to the correct color, of the for example yellow easter egg hit the blue one it was game over. The more correct color sets you get in one game the more coins you will get and with these coins you can upgrade your garden with chickens and other chickens sorts, you can buy toys plants for them and you will get bonuses of them.

2. Second game, it will be a medieval idle game. You started with a lumbermill (or some sort of wood gain), and with that you gain wood. With that wood you can upgrade the lumbermill and also buy a quarry (or some sort of stone gain). With the wood and stone you can upgrade the quarry, and buy a new thing/maker. You had a coal maker, gold mine/maker. You had different tabs in the game, first one the tab with all the buildings so the lumbermill quaryy mines etc., an other tab to upgrade heroes (you can upgrade them after ascention) an other tab for the upgrade tab the research tab so you can get new buildings new mines new technoligies. You also can asvance to next ages. Stone ages, iron/steel age, gold ages. You had millitary you can send away and you will get all these recoures from it, like wood stone gold, all these things you can get from the buildings. Above all these tabs you had a picture of your kingdom village town etc., the picture will update each time you will get a new sort of builing. You also had that the buildings, like a gold mine requires coal from the coal mine and because of that each time you will upgrade your gold mine the coal producting will decrease because the gold mine requires more coal recourse."
