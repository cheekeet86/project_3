By defeating these epic creatures, players gain glory and the favor of the gods. When the game ends, the player who has earned the most glory earns the title of Jarl and is recognized as a champion of Midgard!\n\nPlacing workers allows for the collection of resources and warriors, which players may then send on journeys to neighboring villages or across the sea to defeat monsters and gain the glory they need for victory. Resources are used to carve runes, build ships, and feed your followers. Viking warriors (custom dice) do battle with the myriad enemies the town faces.\n\n\n\n[//]: # (GOTWE)\n\n---------------------\n\nNext Week: [**Quadropolis**](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/176396)\n\n * The GOTW archive and schedule can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/game_of_the_week).\n\n * Vote for future Games of the Week [here](/9fk80h).", "author_fullname": "t2_8x3l5", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Game of the Week: Champions of Midgard", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "GotW"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "gotw", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_cbhq8b", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": "#d0fffd", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 96, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": "326005ee-9cf2-11e8-8b1f-0e8f9a199476", "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "GotW", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 96, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\ud83e\udd16 Obviously a Cylon"}], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1562799416.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 6, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "domain": "self.boardgames", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;#39;s game is &lt;a href=\"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/c1gxRcNaDdjeH8zpLYJEkDEYA5g=/0x0/pic2869714.jpg\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Champions of Midgard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BGG Link&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172287\"&gt;Champions of Midgard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designer&lt;/strong&gt;: Ole Steiness&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publishers&lt;/strong&gt;: Grey Fox Games, Corax Games, Czacha Games, Don&amp;#39;t Panic Games, Ediciones MasQueOca, Games Warehouse, Lavka Games&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Year Released&lt;/strong&gt;: 2015&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanics&lt;/strong&gt;: Card Drafting, Dice Rolling, Set Collection, Variable Player Powers, Worker Placement&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Categories&lt;/strong&gt;: Adventure, Dice, Fantasy, Fighting, Medieval, Mythology&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Players&lt;/strong&gt;: 2 - 4&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Playing Time&lt;/strong&gt;: 90 minutes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expansions&lt;/strong&gt;: Champions of Midgard: Asian Monsters, Champions of Midgard: Bjorn Hammerblow the Fantastic promo, Champions of Midgard: Despised Promo Card, Champions of Midgard: Draudan and Bergrisar King Promo Cards, Champions of Midgard: Gullinkambi Public Boat Promo, Champions of Midgard: Jalev the Adaptable Promo, Champions of Midgard: Jarl Edition, Champions of Midgard: Meeple Monster Promo Card, Champions of Midgard: Mercenaries Land Journey Promo Card, Champions of Midgard: Merchant Ship Promo Cards, Champions of Midgard: Odin&amp;#39;s Trial Promo Card, Champions of Midgard: SeeZam Promo Card, Champions of Midgard: Shipwreck Journey Promo Cards, Champions of Midgard: The Dark Mountains, Champions of Midgard: Valhalla, Champions of Midgard: Valhalla \u2013 Dice Tower 2018 Kickstarter Promo Pack, Champions of Midgard: Virtue Promo Card&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ratings&lt;/strong&gt;:\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Average rating is 7.78982 (rated by 9193 people)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Board Game Rank: 93, Strategy Game Rank: 73&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description from Boardgamegeek&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Champions of Midgard is a middleweight, Viking-themed, worker placement game with dice rolling in which players are leaders of Viking clans who have traveled to an embattled Viking harbor town to help defend it against the threat of trolls, draugr, and other mythological Norse beasts.

And I\u2019m so glad I did. I have recently found the time to dedicate to this game properly and have been making my way through the *curse scenarios.* It has been an absolute blast of an experience and I can\u2019t wait to play more. \nThis game is kind of a slow burn. It\u2019s not face paced, intense action or combat. It is interactive story telling reminiscent of when I read choose your own adventure books as a kid, which is exactly what they were going for. The exploration in this game is so much fun. Every time I get to a new tile, there\u2019s so much I can do. And each choice usually is followed by another either/or decision that can have beneficial or damning consequences. I can craft equipment to help me along, but doing so might eventually cost me unless I\u2019m being smart about how I use my resources. Each gamble I take on following a new path could ultimately leave me sick, hurt, or worse, dead. But the payoff is worth it when I\u2019m rewarded with life-saving medicine, or a weapon to combat danger, or that ever important flame to keep hope alive. \nThe game just tells the narrative so well with such little information presented on the board. Each section of terrain usually has a small piece of story attached to it, with each action also furthering the storyline as your progress. Plus, there\u2019s so many different expansions now that this will have me entertained for a long time trying to get through each one. Granted, I\u2019m sure there will be some slight overlap in cards because after all, there is a finite number in the game of certain options, however the way it is crafted, I doubt this will matter much as the way in which the situation presents will be completely different from any time it has presented before due to circumstance, progression, and game state. \nThe only downside I could see is replay ability eventually running out or growing slightly stale. The first play through everything is new and there\u2019s so many options to explore, you can\u2019t possibly hope to hit all of them. Even if you decide to play through the same story a second and third time I could see it playing out differently because of card mechanics and choices. Eventually, however, it will exhaust itself to where you know all the results and by that point, I will have gotten my money\u2019s worth several times over and I\u2019ll only be too happy to part with the game to let someone else enjoy it for the first time. \nGroup play is great, but it can get a little mucked up because there isn\u2019t really a turn order dynamic and so quarterback or dominant players can often times take over or steamroll decisions, but if you have a solid play group that can work together, the game is a blast to explore with a group. However, solo it definitely shines. It\u2019s one of those games in my collection where when I have a spare hour or two, I can break it out and just enjoy working through the story and seeing where it takes me. The *Save* mechanic that the game incorporates for keeping track of progress as well as easy break down and setup is great. It also becomes part of the story, in which there will be cases where you\u2019ll have to rest and save in order to trigger certain events and replenish certain resources. It\u2019s all just brilliantly designed. \nSo I just cannot sing the praises of this game enough. I know it\u2019s a little tough to find, but if you manage to get your hands on a copy or have the chance to, I highly recommend checking it out as it is an incredible narrative gaming experience. \n\nPlus, the company is so awesome that due to a printing hiccup the first time around, some of the card sizes were misprinted/miscut, and the company resent the proper sized cards to replace the initial run, free of charge. I\u2019m sure that wasn\u2019t cheap, but it was greatly appreciated. The customer service is top notch. I had the pleasure of meeting the designers/creators at GenCon50, who walked me through a play through of the game and were extremely nice, personable, and passionate. They also have a Kickstarter I think coming next year for their next entry in the choose your own adventure style gameplay called 7th Citadel I think? I\u2019ll definitely be on board day 1 of that as well. \n\n**tl;dr / in summary:** The 7th Continent is an amazing gameplay experience and I highly recommend it. It plays incredibly well solo and also is fun in a group setting. If you can find a copy, I cannot recommend enough that you get you pick it up. If you like this type of interactive narrative game, I don\u2019t see how you could be disappointed.
