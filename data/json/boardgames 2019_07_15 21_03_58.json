As temporal agents, you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.\n\nT.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of \"decksploration\". Each player is free to give their character as deep a \"role\" as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it's also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the number of players. Each attempt is called a \"run\"; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players' disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario\u2019s obstacles.\n\nThe base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which \u2014 Asylum \u2014 is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers.\n\nYou usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you'll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice?

As temporal agents, you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;T.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of &amp;quot;decksploration&amp;quot;. Each player is free to give their character as deep a &amp;quot;role&amp;quot; as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it&amp;#39;s also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the number of players. Each attempt is called a &amp;quot;run&amp;quot;; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players&amp;#39; disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario\u2019s obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which \u2014 Asylum \u2014 is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you&amp;#39;ll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the box, an insert allows players to &amp;quot;save&amp;quot; the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game. This way, it&amp;#39;s possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles, the remaining TU, the discovered clues, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;T.I.M.E Stories is a decksploring game in which each deck makes anything possible!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;                Official FAQ\n\n\n                Expansions were published in this order:\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Asylum (base game) (2015)\nT.I.M.E Stories: The Marcy Case (2015)\nT.I.M.E Stories: A Prophecy of Dragons (2016) \nT.I.M.E Stories: Under the Mask (2016) \nT.I.M.E Stories: Expedition \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Endurance (2017) \nT.I.M.E Stories: Lumen Fidei (2017)\nT.I.M.E Stories: Estrella Drive (2017)\nT.I.M.E Stories: Brotherhood of the Coast (2018)\nT.I.M.E Stories: Madame (2019)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Expansions link below also includes many fan-made expansions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next Week: &lt;a href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172287\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Champions of Midgard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GOTW archive and schedule can be found &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/game_of_the_week\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vote for future Games of the Week &lt;a href=\"/9fk80h\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/OWhrWlGdafKKo57HqrZGcNfy4yhrsfyZWlBq31N1Smo.png?auto=webp&amp;s=da1448c8ee37ffb56c6302848b705f029d772774", "width": 2134, "height": 2137}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/OWhrWlGdafKKo57HqrZGcNfy4yhrsfyZWlBq31N1Smo.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=077db69817ec7cbc37b948865bf57187234c75d4", "width": 108, "height": 108}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/OWhrWlGdafKKo57HqrZGcNfy4yhrsfyZWlBq31N1Smo.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58cf31dad5d374060f2aab0a5e613bae805c174d", "width": 216, "height": 216}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/OWhrWlGdafKKo57HqrZGcNfy4yhrsfyZWlBq31N1Smo.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=954ae74d01b437159fd334a33c0f2142e37ddb58", "width": 320, "height": 320}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/OWhrWlGdafKKo57HqrZGcNfy4yhrsfyZWlBq31N1Smo.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b76ef0ce16c8c7ac2ea15391667620cb9085d7c", "width": 640, "height": 640}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/OWhrWlGdafKKo57HqrZGcNfy4yhrsfyZWlBq31N1Smo.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5296b76925a6aed4b4ff35f5bd2b60712daaab3", "width": 960, "height": 961}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/OWhrWlGdafKKo57HqrZGcNfy4yhrsfyZWlBq31N1Smo.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d652c0f45e701a1bb26c95516ea97c94d955285", "width": 1080, "height": 1081}], "variants": {}, "id": "OWhrWlGdafKKo57HqrZGcNfy4yhrsfyZWlBq31N1Smo"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": "\ud83e\udd16 Obviously a Cylon", "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "c8tgcf", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bg3po", "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 44, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/boardgames/comments/c8tgcf/game_of_the_week_time_stories/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c8tgcf/game_of_the_week_time_stories/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2047801, "created_utc": 1562187022.0, "discussion_type": null, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "boardgames", "selftext": "", "author_fullname": "t2_qrryn", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Deck Box Dungeons Review -

There are too many games, too many podcasts, too many blogs. Just too much of everything!\n\nThis is a [modified repost](https://meeplelikeus.co.uk/meeple-monthly-roundup-july-2018/) (with mod permission) of an article that was originally posted on Meeple Like Us and it's aimed at raising the profile of all the great stuff out there you might have missed last year. I'm hoping to do one of these at the start(ish) of each month in 2019.  This post is from 2018.  It's a historical digest - an attempt to make sure great things don't fall into the memory hole.\n\nThere's also a [round up for the previous month](http://meeplelikeus.co.uk/meeple-monthly-roundup-june-2018/) if you want to catch up with what (was) great in tabletop coverage!  As in, what was great in 2018, which is last year.\n\n# Michael\u2019s Links\n\nI\u2019m regularly blown away by how much work people put into their own reskinned version of their favourite games. \u00a0[This remake of Ethnos to fit the Moana theme though](https://imgur.com/a/hNItFN5)\u2026 not only is it a marvelous piece of work it is a very fitting tribute for an absolutely joyful theme. \u00a0\u00a0I see what\u2019s happening, yeah. We\u2019re face to face with greatness and it\u2019s strange.\n\n* * *\n\nHave you been keeping track of the Overturn Kickstarter drama? \u00a0If not, then [this writeup from the Australian Tabletop Gaming Network](http://atgn.com.au/overturn-rising-sands-kickstarter-caught-plagiarising-still-track-funded/) will get you all up to speed. \u00a0As long as the speed and aggression with which KS projects get funded remains a point of pride within this hobby, things like this are going to keep happening. \u00a0\u00a0You\u2019ll also get a lot of hot takes on the [Reddit thread on the controversy](http://atgn.com.au/overturn-rising-sands-kickstarter-caught-plagiarising-still-track-funded/). \u00a0Kickstarter eventually responded by suspending the project, and as you might imagine that provoked [its own thread of spirited discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8zxe1l/overturn_kickstarter_suspended/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=boardgames).\n\n* * *\n\nGiven some of the things that we\u2019ve discussed in the past with regards to paid previews/reviews of games it won\u2019t come as any surprise that we were interested in [this reddit thread on the value of paid previews](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8whr11/heres_a_list_of_the_top_5_games_according_to/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=browse&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=boardgames). \u00a0The key question here is \u2018value for whom?\u2019 \u00a0\n\nA similar thread popped up on BGG and I\u2019ll also [direct your attention that way](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2032372/sad-state-kickstarter-reviews-and-previews).\n\n* * *\n\nConventions can be a tense time for people - they\u2019re loud, busy and often stressful. \u00a0Many people love them and are energised by them. Some though find them intimidating and uncomfortable. \u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ve been through a rough patch regarding conventions but we have this [upbeat tale of a mother and her daughter visiting Dice Tower Con](http://www.meeplemountain.com/articles/a-mother-and-daughter-walk-into-dice-tower-con/) as a more hopeful take.\n\n* * *\n\nTeaching the rules of a game is one of the more constant challenges that face many of us that are enthusiasts for the hobby. \u00a0\u00a0Before anyone gets to have fun they have to listen to a lecture like they walked into some kind of weird board-game classroom. \u00a0[Pawn and Pint put up an interesting video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb-CNylD90w&amp;feature=youtu.be) about how they approach the task and why they do it. \u00a0\n\n* * *\n\nThere are lots of studies that show gaming has a positive impact on depression and other conditions. \u00a0Play Therapy is a real thing and has been a topic of vibrant study for years. I found [this reddit post on boardgaming and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8wzpic/boardgaming_is_helping_me_fight_depression/) to be a heartening read as a personal testimony.\n\n* * *\n\nLast month we pointed you to the work of Ertay over at the Sightless Fun blog as he worked to make Pandemic accessible. \u00a0Well, he\u2019s [done it again with Secret Hitler](https://sightless.fun/Secret-Hitler-Board-Games-You-Can-Play-Blind/) and (obviously) I think you should head over there and check out what he\u2019s been doing.\n\n* * *\n\nBeing a cloistered academic with no real world skills, I\u2019m often profoundly envious of people that actually make things. \u00a0I look at their hobby projects like a dog that\u2019s been fooled by a fake thrown ball one too many times - some kind of trick must be involved, right? \u00a0But no, here\u2019s an [awesome video of a game table](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WbmgpryC5k&amp;feature=youtu.be) being made right in front of you. \u00a0\n\n* * *\n\nIt seems like Kickstarter games are engaged in a constant spiral of oneupsmanship, each trying to outdo each other in terms of the ridiculously lavish and over the top production values they offer backers. \u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s fine and all, although I\u2019m increasingly concerned about the socioeconomic impact such indulgence has on the hobby. I think we can all agree though, I hope, [when your \u2018miniatures\u2019 are bigger than an actual baby](https://twitter.com/eric_lang/status/1015389267701436416) it\u2019s time to take a moment and step back even if it\u2019s just to change the language. \u00a0\n\n* * *\n\nOne of my favourite discussions this week was on a Reddit thread that managed to end up with 146 comments and zero upvotes. \u00a0\u00a0It was on the [Splotter series of games and how the author believes the finished products look like prototypes](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8wyo43/can_we_all_agree_that_splotters_despite_having/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=boardgames). \u00a0There\u2019s a lot in here to consider including the views of those that like the graphic design, those that don\u2019t, and those that take the topic off the rails into more philosophical areas of value, elitism and game design. \u00a0\n\n* * *\n\nHave you at any point found yourself thinking \u2018I wish I knew what BoardGameGeek\u2019s community had collaboratively decided were the best games of each chronological year from 1968 onwards?\u2019. \u00a0\u00a0Admit it, you have - we all have. Well, you can have it Cinders! [Here\u2019s a Reddit post that gives you that exact thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8whr11/heres_a_list_of_the_top_5_games_according_to/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=browse&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=boardgames). \u00a0\u00a0\n\n* * *\n\nKevin Wilson appears relatively frequently in these roundups because his twitter threads are usually very good. \u00a0Here\u2019s [another one on design bandwagons](https://twitter.com/KevinWilson42) and it\u2019s well worth your attention if you\u2019re at all interested in game design.\n\n* * *\n\nAnother great Twitter thread is [this one from Actualol](https://twitter.com/actualol/status/1023709555769987072) on how Twitter itself makes him depressed and distressed on a daily basis. \u00a0There is so much of value in here.

There are too many games, too many podcasts, too many blogs. Just too much of everything!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href=\"https://meeplelikeus.co.uk/meeple-monthly-roundup-july-2018/\"&gt;modified repost&lt;/a&gt; (with mod permission) of an article that was originally posted on Meeple Like Us and it&amp;#39;s aimed at raising the profile of all the great stuff out there you might have missed last year. I&amp;#39;m hoping to do one of these at the start(ish) of each month in 2019.  This post is from 2018.  It&amp;#39;s a historical digest - an attempt to make sure great things don&amp;#39;t fall into the memory hole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s also a &lt;a href=\"http://meeplelikeus.co.uk/meeple-monthly-roundup-june-2018/\"&gt;round up for the previous month&lt;/a&gt; if you want to catch up with what (was) great in tabletop coverage!  As in, what was great in 2018, which is last year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Michael\u2019s Links&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m regularly blown away by how much work people put into their own reskinned version of their favourite games. \u00a0&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/hNItFN5\"&gt;This remake of Ethnos to fit the Moana theme though&lt;/a&gt;\u2026 not only is it a marvelous piece of work it is a very fitting tribute for an absolutely joyful theme. \u00a0\u00a0I see what\u2019s happening, yeah. We\u2019re face to face with greatness and it\u2019s strange.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have you been keeping track of the Overturn Kickstarter drama? \u00a0If not, then &lt;a href=\"http://atgn.com.au/overturn-rising-sands-kickstarter-caught-plagiarising-still-track-funded/\"&gt;this writeup from the Australian Tabletop Gaming Network&lt;/a&gt; will get you all up to speed. \u00a0As long as the speed and aggression with which KS projects get funded remains a point of pride within this hobby, things like this are going to keep happening. \u00a0\u00a0You\u2019ll also get a lot of hot takes on the &lt;a href=\"http://atgn.com.au/overturn-rising-sands-kickstarter-caught-plagiarising-still-track-funded/\"&gt;Reddit thread on the controversy&lt;/a&gt;. \u00a0Kickstarter eventually responded by suspending the project, and as you might imagine that provoked &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8zxe1l/overturn_kickstarter_suspended/?utm_content=title&amp;amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=boardgames\"&gt;its own thread of spirited discussion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given some of the things that we\u2019ve discussed in the past with regards to paid previews/reviews of games it won\u2019t come as any surprise that we were interested in &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8whr11/heres_a_list_of_the_top_5_games_according_to/?utm_content=title&amp;amp;utm_medium=browse&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=boardgames\"&gt;this reddit thread on the value of paid previews&lt;/a&gt;. \u00a0The key question here is \u2018value for whom?\u2019 \u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A similar thread popped up on BGG and I\u2019ll also &lt;a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2032372/sad-state-kickstarter-reviews-and-previews\"&gt;direct your attention that way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Conventions can be a tense time for people - they\u2019re loud, busy and often stressful. \u00a0Many people love them and are energised by them. Some though find them intimidating and uncomfortable. \u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ve been through a rough patch regarding conventions but we have this &lt;a href=\"http://www.meeplemountain.com/articles/a-mother-and-daughter-walk-into-dice-tower-con/\"&gt;upbeat tale of a mother and her daughter visiting Dice Tower Con&lt;/a&gt; as a more hopeful take.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Teaching the rules of a game is one of the more constant challenges that face many of us that are enthusiasts for the hobby. \u00a0\u00a0Before anyone gets to have fun they have to listen to a lecture like they walked into some kind of weird board-game classroom. \u00a0&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb-CNylD90w&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be\"&gt;Pawn and Pint put up an interesting video&lt;/a&gt; about how they approach the task and why they do it. \u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are lots of studies that show gaming has a positive impact on depression and other conditions. \u00a0Play Therapy is a real thing and has been a topic of vibrant study for years. I found &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8wzpic/boardgaming_is_helping_me_fight_depression/\"&gt;this reddit post on boardgaming and depression&lt;/a&gt; to be a heartening read as a personal testimony.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last month we pointed you to the work of Ertay over at the Sightless Fun blog as he worked to make Pandemic accessible. \u00a0Well, he\u2019s &lt;a href=\"https://sightless.fun/Secret-Hitler-Board-Games-You-Can-Play-Blind/\"&gt;done it again with Secret Hitler&lt;/a&gt; and (obviously) I think you should head over there and check out what he\u2019s been doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being a cloistered academic with no real world skills, I\u2019m often profoundly envious of people that actually make things. \u00a0I look at their hobby projects like a dog that\u2019s been fooled by a fake thrown ball one too many times - some kind of trick must be involved, right? \u00a0But no, here\u2019s an &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WbmgpryC5k&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be\"&gt;awesome video of a game table&lt;/a&gt; being made right in front of you. \u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems like Kickstarter games are engaged in a constant spiral of oneupsmanship, each trying to outdo each other in terms of the ridiculously lavish and over the top production values they offer backers. \u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s fine and all, although I\u2019m increasingly concerned about the socioeconomic impact such indulgence has on the hobby. I think we can all agree though, I hope, &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/eric_lang/status/1015389267701436416\"&gt;when your \u2018miniatures\u2019 are bigger than an actual baby&lt;/a&gt; it\u2019s time to take a moment and step back even if it\u2019s just to change the language. \u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite discussions this week was on a Reddit thread that managed to end up with 146 comments and zero upvotes. \u00a0\u00a0It was on the &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8wyo43/can_we_all_agree_that_splotters_despite_having/?utm_content=title&amp;amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=boardgames\"&gt;Splotter series of games and how the author believes the finished products look like prototypes&lt;/a&gt;. \u00a0There\u2019s a lot in here to consider including the views of those that like the graphic design, those that don\u2019t, and those that take the topic off the rails into more philosophical areas of value, elitism and game design. \u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have you at any point found yourself thinking \u2018I wish I knew what BoardGameGeek\u2019s community had collaboratively decided were the best games of each chronological year from 1968 onwards?\u2019. \u00a0\u00a0Admit it, you have - we all have.
