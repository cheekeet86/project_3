start drawing lines in the sand, roll-and-write games have been popular. Despite its popularity, Yahtzee often gets dismissed quite quickly by gamers looking for more decisions. Enter Qwixx, a dice game from 2012, which brought all players into the game - even when it wasn't your turn. It won a lot of awards, and helped bring back the roll-and-write game into the spotlight. But Qwixx was still a very light game, and that's where **That's Pretty Clever** (2018) comes in. Originally called **Ganz sch\u00f6n clever**, this game is clever. But it's also addictive, fast, and fun. And perhaps most importantly for gamers: it has depth.\n\n**Game-play**\n\nThe game-play seems familiar at first - you're rolling dice, keeping some, and re-rolling. But what makes That's Pretty Clever especially interesting is that you'll enter the dice you roll into coloured areas, trying to set yourself up to score chains of points later in the game. And you need to think about the fact that any dice you don't use yourself have the potential to be used by other players. It's ever so addictive, and once you grok the game-play, you'll find yourself playing it over and over, in your quest to get the highest score. In fact, you'll like it that much, that you'll probably even play it on your own.\n\n**Impressions**\n\nThat's Pretty Clever is an outstanding roll-and-write game, and deserves all the praise it has received. It won't be for everyone, because it's not the light and carefree filler that it first appears to be. So if you're expecting a simple Yahtzee style game, you'll be in for somewhat of a surprise. But this is exactly why it was nominated for the Kennerspiel des Jahres, and not the more family-friendly Spiel des Jahres award. The fun in this game lies in the combos, and you'll need to plan ahead to try to set these up, which involves some real crunchiness. There's still some luck, since it's a dice game after all, and this will at times frustrate you. But the game is engaging enough - especially once you start hitting some combos - to keep you come back to it, over and over!\n\nDespite the absence of theme, the real appeal here is how it creates the feel of being an engine builder, while remaining a relatively simple dice game. You're doing much more than just pushing your luck, like in most roll-and-write dice games. Instead you're drafting dice in a way that is ... well ... clever! This may make it a little more meaty than what the average family or non-gamer is prepared to handle, but gamers will lap it up. Expect some tough decision making, which will prove especially rewarding as you start triggering chains of points. I wouldn't suggest playing with more than 3 players, due to the risk of down-time, but for 2-3 players it's just perfect. The solo option and app are fantastic as well.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nHas the roll-and-write finally grown up? Unsurprisingly, That's Pretty Clever has been a huge hit ever since it came out in 2018, and has been nominated for some big awards, including the 2018 Kennerspiel des Jahre.

Despite its popularity, Yahtzee often gets dismissed quite quickly by gamers looking for more decisions. Enter Qwixx, a dice game from 2012, which brought all players into the game - even when it wasn&amp;#39;t your turn. It won a lot of awards, and helped bring back the roll-and-write game into the spotlight. But Qwixx was still a very light game, and that&amp;#39;s where &lt;strong&gt;That&amp;#39;s Pretty Clever&lt;/strong&gt; (2018) comes in. Originally called &lt;strong&gt;Ganz sch\u00f6n clever&lt;/strong&gt;, this game is clever. But it&amp;#39;s also addictive, fast, and fun. And perhaps most importantly for gamers: it has depth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game-play&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game-play seems familiar at first - you&amp;#39;re rolling dice, keeping some, and re-rolling. But what makes That&amp;#39;s Pretty Clever especially interesting is that you&amp;#39;ll enter the dice you roll into coloured areas, trying to set yourself up to score chains of points later in the game. And you need to think about the fact that any dice you don&amp;#39;t use yourself have the potential to be used by other players. It&amp;#39;s ever so addictive, and once you grok the game-play, you&amp;#39;ll find yourself playing it over and over, in your quest to get the highest score. In fact, you&amp;#39;ll like it that much, that you&amp;#39;ll probably even play it on your own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impressions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s Pretty Clever is an outstanding roll-and-write game, and deserves all the praise it has received. It won&amp;#39;t be for everyone, because it&amp;#39;s not the light and carefree filler that it first appears to be. So if you&amp;#39;re expecting a simple Yahtzee style game, you&amp;#39;ll be in for somewhat of a surprise. But this is exactly why it was nominated for the Kennerspiel des Jahres, and not the more family-friendly Spiel des Jahres award. The fun in this game lies in the combos, and you&amp;#39;ll need to plan ahead to try to set these up, which involves some real crunchiness. There&amp;#39;s still some luck, since it&amp;#39;s a dice game after all, and this will at times frustrate you. But the game is engaging enough - especially once you start hitting some combos - to keep you come back to it, over and over!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the absence of theme, the real appeal here is how it creates the feel of being an engine builder, while remaining a relatively simple dice game. You&amp;#39;re doing much more than just pushing your luck, like in most roll-and-write dice games. Instead you&amp;#39;re drafting dice in a way that is ... well ... clever! This may make it a little more meaty than what the average family or non-gamer is prepared to handle, but gamers will lap it up. Expect some tough decision making, which will prove especially rewarding as you start triggering chains of points. I wouldn&amp;#39;t suggest playing with more than 3 players, due to the risk of down-time, but for 2-3 players it&amp;#39;s just perfect. The solo option and app are fantastic as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Has the roll-and-write finally grown up? Unsurprisingly, That&amp;#39;s Pretty Clever has been a huge hit ever since it came out in 2018, and has been nominated for some big awards, including the 2018 Kennerspiel des Jahre. It also went on to win the Golden Geek for 2018 Best Solo Board Game.

So I've only got perhaps a third of what I usually play during 3 months. So that's why I have limited plays of these new games.  \nLike last time, it's only my opinions, not actually educated reviews :)  \n    \n**Castles of Caladale** (2017), (3 plays, 2x2p 1x3p)  \nI saw a Rahdo run through of this some time ago that got me interested, and recently found it at my FLGS at half price so I picked it up. It was an ok filler, fast and at first nice that it was not very strict how you placed your tiles. But I played it 3 times in April and haven't thought about it once since then, and now the lack of strictness is what is making me not want to play it again. One of my friends really liked it though, so might keep it anyway. 4/10.  \n  \n**Wreck Raiders** (2019) (2 plays, 2x2p)  \nI Kickstarted this so I'm biased, but I loved this. There were some great decisions to be made, choosing the dice, placing your diver, and what to collect. I've only played it twice, I've had it difficult to get people to play it, some say the theme doesn't speak to them and that it sounds like a children's game. It might be aimed at families, but it's really great. I would like to play it with more players, as you keep helping your opponent too much on your own turns with 2 players (the worker next to where you place your worker also gets a treasure). Need to play more, but it's at 8.5/10 right now.  \n  \n**Jaipur** (2009), (2 plays, 2x2p)  \nI mostly got this to play with my gf, we needed a new fast 2 player game after I destroyed Star Realms for us by playing it on the app and became much better than her. While Jaipur is a great game, it's not a replacement for those times we used to play Star Realms, it doesn't do it for us. We tried it twice at least, and I can see what people like about it. We'll see if we play it again. 6/10.  \n  \n**The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-earth** (2019) (2 plays, 1x2p, 1x5p)  \nI'm a big Mansions of Madness 2e fan, and when I heard that they would make a LotR game in the same fashion, I was super excited. Then came many of the reviews, and from what I saw, it was a mediocre game. Well, they were wrong! This fits perfect for me, my gf, and my gaming group, and I think this is a game that thrive on the right group to play with. The card mechanism instead of rolling dice is excellent, the app is great, the tiles are beautiful, and the minis are really nice. Can't say that it really feels like a LotR game though, it could be any fantasy world, and they probably should have gone for that, but hey, they made me buy it ;) And Fantasy Flight has finally learned to number their damn map tiles! In MoM2e it's always a pain in the ass to find \"Street corner 2\" which there's several of. So I've only played this twice, but we'll play it a lot during the coming months and I think it will grow on me more. It's not gonna replace MoM2e for me though, but it's nice with a different theme and shorter play time. 8/10.  \n  \n**The Palace of Mad King Ludwig** (1 play, 1x2p)  \nI hoped to get to play this again before I wrote this but I wasn't able to, so my opinions of this game is limited. Castles of Mad King Ludwig is one of my favorite games, so I wanted this in my collection myself, but my friend bought it so I tried his copy instead. And I must say, this was really strange to play, it felt like a mix of CoMKL and Surburbia, but somehow they manage to make it... underwhelming. I was thinking all the time \"oh it's like Suburbia here, wow! Oh it's like CoMKL there, wow!\", and when the game finished I wasn't at all excited about it. They tried to do so much but perhaps did too much. The tile placement was a little bit interesting, but then the tiles were really busy and hard to see, and some of the colors and icons didn't match. It was a mess. I still want to play it again but with more players. But right now, 5/10.  \n  \n**Copenhagen** (2019), (2 plays, 1x2p, 1x3p)  \nI live close to Copenhagen so this caught my attention, and I do like placing polyominoes, Patchwork is another favorite. And it felt a little bit like Patchwork (or similar) mixed with Ticket to Ride, but the special powers are what made this game different, and much better. I liked it, it was easy, fast and fun. The table presence was excellent too, and having the first to 12 points being the winner made the pace of the game really satisfying. I think I will play this a lot more during the year. 7/10.  \n  \n**Minecraft** (2019) (1 play, 1x3p)  \nTried the prototype of the upcoming Minecraft game. I'm not allowed to say anything about it, sorry. But I liked it more than I thought I would.  \n  \n**Herbaceous Sprouts** (2019) (1 play, 1x3p)  \nI bought this because I thought the theme was really nice and Steve Finn always gets my attention, he does some really nice and cosy games. I liked my one play of this, it's a quite short game and each turn is fast so not much waiting. You still have interesting choices to make each turn and I can see me playing this more. For now, 6 or 7/10.  \n  \n**Let's Make a Bus Route** (2018) (1 play, 1x4p)  \nOnly played this once, but I'm almost ready to give it a 10. I dreamt about this when I went to bed, seriously. This is a draw and write game where you make a bus route in Kyoto, each turn you draw a card which tells you what you need to draw on the map, and the card means different for each player, and you write on the same map. It's really great! One player managed to draw himself into a corner, which means you're eliminated from the game, and that sucked, I hate excluding people. But I guess you have to pay attention, and it really isn't that long game anyway. For now, 9/10.  \n  \n**Ticket to Ride: Switzerland** (2007), (1 play, 1x2p)  \nAnother game I've only played once. Ok, so not technically a new game, but I log them separately in BGstats so I count it as new. Switzerland was a good map, I like these small maps for lower player count. The Nordic map is my favorite, and this was almost as good, it was interesting that the locomotive cards could only be used for tunnels, even if it was annoying at some points :) If I were to put a number on this, I would want to rate it within the world of TTR, and then I place it third. Nordic first, then Europe, the Switzerland. And then I'll give it a 7/10.  \n  \nThat's it for the second quarter. Hope to get more games played during the summer.  \nHere's some short updates on the games I played during Q1.  \n**Just One**, played another 4 times and I like it even more. It's now 8/10 for me. Really the only party game I've liked this much.  \n**Quacks of Quedlingburg**, another 2 plays, still think it's great, but my friend bought his own copy, so I don't get to play it as much as I'd like, but very proud to introduce him to a game he bought himself :) Still 8/10.  \n**Space Base**, the game I've perhaps played the most since last post with 6 more plays. Love this game though I never win, it's so pleasing to almost always get something, even if it's not your turn. Finally got my gf to play it and she absolutely hated it, too much luck, so yeah I guess I won't play it as much as I hoped :P It's 8/10 for me now though.", "author_fullname": "t2_3q0hb", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "I played another 10 new games (to me) during Q2.

Need to play more, but it&amp;#39;s at 8.5/10 right now.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jaipur&lt;/strong&gt; (2009), (2 plays, 2x2p)&lt;br/&gt;\nI mostly got this to play with my gf, we needed a new fast 2 player game after I destroyed Star Realms for us by playing it on the app and became much better than her. While Jaipur is a great game, it&amp;#39;s not a replacement for those times we used to play Star Realms, it doesn&amp;#39;t do it for us. We tried it twice at least, and I can see what people like about it. We&amp;#39;ll see if we play it again. 6/10.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-earth&lt;/strong&gt; (2019) (2 plays, 1x2p, 1x5p)&lt;br/&gt;\nI&amp;#39;m a big Mansions of Madness 2e fan, and when I heard that they would make a LotR game in the same fashion, I was super excited. Then came many of the reviews, and from what I saw, it was a mediocre game. Well, they were wrong! This fits perfect for me, my gf, and my gaming group, and I think this is a game that thrive on the right group to play with. The card mechanism instead of rolling dice is excellent, the app is great, the tiles are beautiful, and the minis are really nice. Can&amp;#39;t say that it really feels like a LotR game though, it could be any fantasy world, and they probably should have gone for that, but hey, they made me buy it ;) And Fantasy Flight has finally learned to number their damn map tiles! In MoM2e it&amp;#39;s always a pain in the ass to find &amp;quot;Street corner 2&amp;quot; which there&amp;#39;s several of. So I&amp;#39;ve only played this twice, but we&amp;#39;ll play it a lot during the coming months and I think it will grow on me more. It&amp;#39;s not gonna replace MoM2e for me though, but it&amp;#39;s nice with a different theme and shorter play time. 8/10.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Palace of Mad King Ludwig&lt;/strong&gt; (1 play, 1x2p)&lt;br/&gt;\nI hoped to get to play this again before I wrote this but I wasn&amp;#39;t able to, so my opinions of this game is limited. Castles of Mad King Ludwig is one of my favorite games, so I wanted this in my collection myself, but my friend bought it so I tried his copy instead. And I must say, this was really strange to play, it felt like a mix of CoMKL and Surburbia, but somehow they manage to make it... underwhelming. I was thinking all the time &amp;quot;oh it&amp;#39;s like Suburbia here, wow! Oh it&amp;#39;s like CoMKL there, wow!&amp;quot;, and when the game finished I wasn&amp;#39;t at all excited about it. They tried to do so much but perhaps did too much. The tile placement was a little bit interesting, but then the tiles were really busy and hard to see, and some of the colors and icons didn&amp;#39;t match. It was a mess. I still want to play it again but with more players. But right now, 5/10.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copenhagen&lt;/strong&gt; (2019), (2 plays, 1x2p, 1x3p)&lt;br/&gt;\nI live close to Copenhagen so this caught my attention, and I do like placing polyominoes, Patchwork is another favorite. And it felt a little bit like Patchwork (or similar) mixed with Ticket to Ride, but the special powers are what made this game different, and much better. I liked it, it was easy, fast and fun. The table presence was excellent too, and having the first to 12 points being the winner made the pace of the game really satisfying. I think I will play this a lot more during the year. 7/10.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minecraft&lt;/strong&gt; (2019) (1 play, 1x3p)&lt;br/&gt;\nTried the prototype of the upcoming Minecraft game. I&amp;#39;m not allowed to say anything about it, sorry. But I liked it more than I thought I would.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Herbaceous Sprouts&lt;/strong&gt; (2019) (1 play, 1x3p)&lt;br/&gt;\nI bought this because I thought the theme was really nice and Steve Finn always gets my attention, he does some really nice and cosy games. I liked my one play of this, it&amp;#39;s a quite short game and each turn is fast so not much waiting. You still have interesting choices to make each turn and I can see me playing this more. For now, 6 or 7/10.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let&amp;#39;s Make a Bus Route&lt;/strong&gt; (2018) (1 play, 1x4p)&lt;br/&gt;\nOnly played this once, but I&amp;#39;m almost ready to give it a 10. I dreamt about this when I went to bed, seriously. This is a draw and write game where you make a bus route in Kyoto, each turn you draw a card which tells you what you need to draw on the map, and the card means different for each player, and you write on the same map. It&amp;#39;s really great! One player managed to draw himself into a corner, which means you&amp;#39;re eliminated from the game, and that sucked, I hate excluding people. But I guess you have to pay attention, and it really isn&amp;#39;t that long game anyway. For now, 9/10.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ticket to Ride: Switzerland&lt;/strong&gt; (2007), (1 play, 1x2p)&lt;br/&gt;\nAnother game I&amp;#39;ve only played once. Ok, so not technically a new game, but I log them separately in BGstats so I count it as new. Switzerland was a good map, I like these small maps for lower player count. The Nordic map is my favorite, and this was almost as good, it was interesting that the locomotive cards could only be used for tunnels, even if it was annoying at some points :) If I were to put a number on this, I would want to rate it within the world of TTR, and then I place it third. Nordic first, then Europe, the Switzerland. And then I&amp;#39;ll give it a 7/10.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it for the second quarter. Hope to get more games played during the summer.&lt;br/&gt;\nHere&amp;#39;s some short updates on the games I played during Q1.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Just One&lt;/strong&gt;, played another 4 times and I like it even more. It&amp;#39;s now 8/10 for me. Really the only party game I&amp;#39;ve liked this much.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Quacks of Quedlingburg&lt;/strong&gt;, another 2 plays, still think it&amp;#39;s great, but my friend bought his own copy, so I don&amp;#39;t get to play it as much as I&amp;#39;d like, but very proud to introduce him to a game he bought himself :) Still 8/10.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Space Base&lt;/strong&gt;, the game I&amp;#39;ve perhaps played the most since last post with 6 more plays. Love this game though I never win, it&amp;#39;s so pleasing to almost always get something, even if it&amp;#39;s not your turn. Finally got my gf to play it and she absolutely hated it, too much luck, so yeah I guess I won&amp;#39;t play it as much as I hoped :P It&amp;#39;s 8/10 for me now though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": "Castles Of Mad King Ludwig", "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "c8762b", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "robaanrobio", "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 56, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/boardgames/comments/c8762b/i_played_another_10_new_games_to_me_during_q2/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c8762b/i_played_another_10_new_games_to_me_during_q2/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2047801, "created_utc": 1562059938.0, "discussion_type": null, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "boardgames", "selftext": "Seriously loving this game.

I went on less than four hours after I received the email and when I went to add my To The Barricades, it said sold out. It said copies were limited and there MIGHT be more available later, in August, well after the widow for refunds. This does not seem right or fair to me and feels like bait and switch. Neither statement above from Kickstarter page suggest anything about any kind of limited supply.\n\nIt appears many others are unhappy about this, but am I overreacting in being supremely annoyed by this?  Is this a violation of any of Kickstarters rules?  I've reached out to AEG in a number of emails and am really hoping they can rectify this, but unless the decide to offer the add-on to those who want it I would be very hesitant to back AEG Kickstarters in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate 1:  They today posted an update on the Kickstarter.\n\n**\"Thunderstone Quest: New Horizons came to a successful conclusion on Kickstarter on June 28th.

So even if I wanted to wait and see, I don't know how I would go about it. Just add 50 bucks and hope they decide to? What happens to my money if the decide not to?

YOU WILL LOSE YOUR EXPEDITED STATUS IF YOU CHANGE YOUR REWARD TO YOUR INVENTORY IS FULL.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the default Expedited Reward that your order already has selectedOn the Add-on screen, select the &amp;quot;Your Inventory is Full Add-on for Expedited Orders&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have any questions or concerns about altering your Expedited order please email&lt;/strong&gt; [&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"mailto:kickstarter@alderac.com\"&gt;kickstarter@alderac.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;](mailto:&lt;a href=\"mailto:kickstarter@alderac.com\"&gt;kickstarter@alderac.com&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;before making any changes and we&amp;#39;ll be glad to help.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Champion &amp;amp; To the Barricades Add-OnsSupplies of Champion and To the Barricades are limited. As a result, we have configured the system to allow just 1 of each to be added to each order. And when they are sold out, we won&amp;#39;t be able to offer any additional units.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have any questions or concerns please email&lt;/strong&gt; [&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"mailto:kickstarter@alderac.com\"&gt;kickstarter@alderac.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;](mailto:&lt;a href=\"mailto:kickstarter@alderac.com\"&gt;kickstarter@alderac.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;strong&gt;. This email address should be your primary point of contact with us regarding this Kickstarter; messages sent via Kickstarter, Facebook, BGG, or other communications channels are not necessarily going to be read and responded to.-- The AEG Thunderstone Team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This mentions the limited stock but does not address the fact that all statements before made it clear that anyone who wanted To The Barricades would be able to add it. This is unfortunate and does seem to address concerns others have brought the their attention. I encourage anyone to email them at the address provided.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The PM closed the end of July, so well before the even decide on if more Barricades copies will be made. So even if I wanted to wait and see, I don&amp;#39;t know how I would go about it. Just add 50 bucks and hope they decide to? What happens to my money if the decide not to? Would I be forced to use it on something I don&amp;#39;t want or just lose it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update 2:  This was posted in the comments on the Kickstarter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@All - with regard to the availability (or lack thereof) of To the Barricades, no matter what the final outcome is, for any backer feels that they were not treated fairly with regard to this issue, we will offer a 100% refund of any portion or all of their pledge regardless of when they make that decision.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really appreciate this update and the fact that they are offering full refunds outside of the 7 days window.  Hopefully they will provide an update that still gives us an opportunity to get the &amp;quot;To the Barricades&amp;quot; content.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/P6z93QWCk9zDDmgy4bB05OAeI4ea4P0-rCYrfJOOemc.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=9e48d3e0b06fae2ea4670120b263f1262fe2ac37", "width": 560, "height": 315}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/P6z93QWCk9zDDmgy4bB05OAeI4ea4P0-rCYrfJOOemc.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a74dba75be8607a5d3942ee21ee72a06591318b", "width": 108, "height": 60}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/P6z93QWCk9zDDmgy4bB05OAeI4ea4P0-rCYrfJOOemc.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=886615f42ee4211e08f86c949c4ca3928a89d948", "width": 216, "height": 121}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/P6z93QWCk9zDDmgy4bB05OAeI4ea4P0-rCYrfJOOemc.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e52bf5ed86404357397e17bcddd75233d2a1736c", "width": 320, "height": 180}], "variants": {}, "id": "YqyXDfJATo4SCrnH33gZsJD1e9gfei621mnrIjekl84"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "cb8c5e48-1d10-11e6-baf6-0e4fba3cf49f", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "c8gyq0", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Joepancreas", "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 7, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/boardgames/comments/c8gyq0/thunderstone_quest_issues_with_latest_kickstarter/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c8gyq0/thunderstone_quest_issues_with_latest_kickstarter/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2047801, "created_utc": 1562111629.0, "discussion_type": null, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "boardgames", "selftext": "Wanted to see what new games everyone was digging this year so far!

The first game that showed me the breadth of the hobby was **Conquest of the Empire** which my friends and I would play and argue over at sleepovers into the wee hours of the morning. I have fond memories of these session even though the playthroughs were often disastrous due to disagreements over the rules. Around this time I bought **Smallworld**, **Catan**, **Ticket to Ride**.\n\nSoon after I bought **Agricola** which showed me the strategic depth of Euro games and worker placement games.

Most of these games are either heavy strategy games or good 2p games for my girlfriend and I to play. As my pre-order list probably indicates, I love Splotter games. I've played **Food Chain Magnate** about 15 times and it is probably my favorite game currently. I quite enjoy **Antiquity** too though it plays much differently.\n\nAbout 8 months ago I got bit by the **18xx** bug.
