Despite its haters, games like Yahtzee (1956) have always been popular. So rather than criticize this old chestnut for its faults or limitations, why not piggyback on its success, and use it as a stepping stone to introduce fans to the newer generation of roll-and-write games? This class includes the award-winning Qwixx (2012), which has everyone involved even on other player's turns.  Then comes **That's Pretty Clever** (2018), which is a much more meaty game geared to satisfy gamers. It has made a big splash, and has proven very popular. Many gamers will insist that it is their favourite roll-and-write game ever! Like most dice games, it's fast, fun, and addictive, but it adds elements of real strategy and depth. \n\nAnd now the following year, along comes its sequel, **Twice As Clever** (2019), with both games being brought to the American market by publisher Stronghold Games. Like the original, this new title comes from designer Wolfgang Warsch, and is a dice-rolling game for 1-4 players, playable in under half an hour. \n\n**Game-play**\n\nThe rules of Twice As Clever are basically the same as That's Pretty Clever, as you're rolling and re-rolling dice, marking off squares in your scoring grid. What's different, however, is a new silver die that lets you score with multiple dice, and also a new power. The result is an even more deep and strategic game! If you liked That's Pretty Clever, but wanted an even greater challenge, then Twice As Clever is the perfect game for you. You'll love this just as much - or if the title is any indication, perhaps twice as much!\n\n**Impressions**\n\nThat's Pretty Clever was rightly praised as being a terrific roll-and-write game. What gave it appeal to gamers was that it offered so much more than standard dice-rolling fillers like Yahtzee. Now Twice As Clever (2019) has come along, offering an even more meaty experience. It continues the successful formula of the original, and if you really enjoyed that, you're likely to enjoy this too. The basic concept that made the original game great has been retained, and what has been added are some new scoring possibilities and features. These make it an even more thoughtful and satisfying experience for those who like to really chew on their decisions.\n\nIf you're only going to get one of these games, you should make your decision based on your preferred level of complexity and depth. Twice As Clever certainly offers the deeper experience of the two, so if it's a more strategic and meaty game that you are looking for, then this is likely going to be the one you enjoy the most. Even then, you will probably get the most out of it by starting with That's Pretty Clever, playing that over and over until you're ready for a new challenge, and only then moving up to Twice As Clever. On the other hand if you're more likely to enjoy a lighter-medium weight game, then That's Pretty Clever is probably the game to get anyway. While its depth might scare off some gateway gamers, it can also be ideal for the purpose of bringing newcomers to the fold. Either way, That's Pretty Clever is the place that almost everyone should start with, and if you really love it, then you can always move up to Twice As Clever when you want to step up the level of complexity, while offering more of the same style of game-play.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nBoth of these games are great additions to the gaming market. It's wonderful to see the roll-and-write genre being invigorated and populated by titles that don't sacrifice depth of thought. While light dice-rolling fillers like Yahtzee will always be popular in the mass market, it's good to see that there are solid options in the roll-and-write category for gamers as well. And you can't do much better than That's Pretty Clever and its sequel Twice As Clever. Especially for gamers, I recommend them both very highly!\n\n ***Where to get it?*** *Twice As Clever is now available from the publisher Stronghold Games (*[*here*](https://strongholdgames.com/store/board-games/twice-as-clever-doppelt-so-clever/)*)*.", "author_fullname": "t2_1k126tck", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Impressions of Twice As Clever (Doppelt so clever) - The hottest roll-and-write dice game just became deeper!", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Review"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "review", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_c9bvtb", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Review", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1562331301.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 6, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.boardgames", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The hottest roll-and-write dice game just became a more satisfying and deeper experience!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the genre of roll-and-write games has been enjoying something of a resurgence.

I've always been into video games but lately have been using video games to scratch that board game fix. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've tried before to use digital recreations of board games to scratch the itch but they don't work for me. They usually run into two problems. First, you play against an AI that just doesn't feel like the same as playing a real humor or it's online multiplayer but it's just too slow.

I was surprised to see that several of the designers of  the game responded to my original post (turns out I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, they comment quite often and are very interactive with the Spirit Island player-base). One in particular was Ted Vessenes. His comment sent my mind racing on how I could have done this better:\n\n&gt;I would break down the process like this:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Part 1:** Name and thematic description  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Part 2:** Special rule and play style description  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Part 3:** Innates  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Part 4:** Unique Powers  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Part 5:** Growth  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Part 6:** Structural testing (\"Does it even work?\")  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Part 7:** Coherence testing (\"Do all the pieces contribute?\")  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Part 8:** Balance testing (\"Is power level appropriate?\")  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You might notice that when I choose to respond to custom designs, I'll almost always comment on only the first thing in this list that I think needs design. It's because these things affect each other in layers-- changing the special rule will change what Innate Powers  you want, which can change what unique powers you want. But changing a unique power only rarely makes you want to change special rules.\n\nHis comment about how each part affects all the other parts in layers is what struck me. Things needed to be cemented down in a previous part before you could reasonably start on the next part. So I went back down the list with my Spirit and quickly found things that needed to change:\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n* **Part 1 - Name/Description:**\n   * Name: Shifting Desert\u2019s Gaping Maw\n   * Thematic Description: A Sand Spirit that draws in intruders and devours them\n      * Elemental Affinity: Major/Minor/Other\n* **Part 2 - Special Rule(s):**\n   * Only place Presence in Sands.\n      * I was fine with this, I like the limited range aspect of the Spirit, it gives it some obvious flaws that it will have to find a way around in the future.\n   * Gather when Presence is placed.\n      * Here\u2019s where we run into some problems. It was obvious from the first play-test that this Special Rule was too powerful. The thematic fantasy of the Spirit was already being fulfilled by the second Innate Power, so I didn\u2019t need to add it into the Special Rules as well.\n   * Convert Plant and Water into Sun\n      * I liked the idea, but was a little strange in execution. It also meant that my Spirit could never help with certain Events that arose during play. That felt bad, so this needed to be changed as well.\n\nSo as you can see, I was stopped on only step 2 of 8, revealing to me that I needed to work on the fundamentals once more before I moved on to the actual number-tweaking and other intricate parts of balance.\n\nI brainstormed for quite a while on Special Rules that would help the Spirit be interesting, but not overpowered. I settled on removing the 2nd and 3rd Special Rule and adding in a variant of the 3rd one. It would still do what I wanted, but to a more controllable/interactive level.\n\n**You may pay X Energy to gain X Sun Elements**\n\nThat sounded a lot better to me and removing the original gathering Special Rule was an obvious choice anyway. This would still allow me to have larger counts of Sun Elements and would put the Energy I was gaining to good use.\n\nNow I was able to move on to the next piece.\n\n* **Part 3 - Innate Powers**\n   * I analyzed the Innate Powers and decided to shift the Elemental thresholds around. I gave the devour Innate Power all the Earth Elements and the gathering Innate Power all of the Sun Elements.\n   * I made the gathering Innate Power slow and placed a limit on it by forcing the player to pay Energy (a la the Special Rule) to be able to Gather Invaders.\n\nSo now they looked like this:\n\n* The Ravenous Hunger Devours\n   * Slow, Range 0, Any\n   * Threshold #1: 1 Earth, 1 Sun\n      * Deal 2 Damage.\n   * Threshold #2: 3 Earth 1 Air, 3 Sun\n      * Instead, deal 6 Damage.\n   * Threshold #3: 5 Earth 2, Air, 5 Sun\n      * Instead, deal 12 Damage.\n   * Notes: For each Town or City destroyed by this effect, +1 Fear.\n* Mirage Leads to Certain Demise\n   * Fast, Range 0, Any\n   * Threshold #1: 3 Sun, 1 Air\n      * Gather 1 Explorer per Sun\n   * Threshold #2: 6 Sun, 2 Air\n      * Gather 1 Town per 2 Sun.\n   * Threshold #3: 10 Sun, 4 Air\n      * Gather all Explorers or Towns.\n   * Threshold #4: 5 Air\n      * You may repeat the Power.\n\nWith a new set of Innate Powers that seemed harder to reach, but just as rewarding for doing so (or so I thought), I moved on to the next part.\n\n* **Part 4 - Unique Power Cards:**\n   * Bottomless Pits of Quicksand -&gt; Blinding Sandstorms\n      * 3 Cost, Fast, Range 1, Any land\n      * Invaders skip all Actions in target land this turn.\n      * Elements: Sun/Air/Earth\n   * Scorch with Desert Heat\n      * 2-&gt;1 Cost, Slow, Range 1, Any land\n      * 1 Damage\n      * \\+1 Damage if target land is Sand\n      * Elements: Sun/Fire/Air -&gt; Sun/Fire\n   * Singing Dunes of Sand -&gt; Grit and Gravel Chip Away\n      * 1 Cost, Slow, Range 1, Any land\n      * 1 Damage to each Town/City.\n      * Elements: Earth/Fire\n   * Thrashing Walls of Sand -&gt; Smothering Wall of Sand\n      * 2 Cost, Slow, Range 1, Any land\n      * 1 Fear.\n      * Push up to 3 Explorers/Towns/Dahan OR Destroy 1 Town.\n      * Elements: Air/Fire/Earth/Sun\n\nThe Unique Power Cards changed the most since I wasn\u2019t happy with how most of them played in the first play-test. Turns out I still had a lot to learn when it comes to crafting Unique Power Cards in general in terms of effects and balance. These would continue to change and fluctuate from this point all the way to the end of the balancing cycle.\n\n* **Part 5 - Growth Options:**\n   * Reclaim All, Gain a Power Card -&gt; Reclaim All, Gain 1 Energy, Gain Earth OR Sun\n   * Add a Presence (Range 3), Gain a Power Card.\n   * Add a Presence (Range 0), Gain 2 Energy.\n\nShifting Desert isn\u2019t primarily an Earth Spirit, so I didn\u2019t want the Reclaim to be terribly strong. But it has Earth as the secondary Element, so I wanted it to be slightly better than some Reclaim All combinations.\n\nParts 6 through 8 are for play-testing, so I\u2019m not going to go into that any more in this article.\n\nSo now you\u2019ve seen how a lot of things can be revealed when play-testing what you\u2019ve created. These revelations can in turn change a lot of the design of your Spirit (especially when your fundamentals aren\u2019t in place completely).\n\nI recommend anyone who wants to make their own Spirit follow the advice given above. It makes the process more streamlined and helps to identify problems earlier in the design.\n\nNext time will be the final article where I reveal what I consider to be the (nearly) finished Spirit and give tips for how to play-test efficiently in addition to a smattering of lessons that I learned that I think will be useful to everyone else who attempts something like this.", "author_fullname": "t2_nqwfg", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Spirit Island Home-brew - Pt. 4 - Back to the Drawing Board", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_c922pk", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 48, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": "2fdfa772-9cf0-11e8-922c-0e3a76b3c6b0", "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 48, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1562589539.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"a": ":spirit_island:", "e": "emoji", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/5dhccdeqncf11_t5_2qmjp/spirit_island"}, {"e": "text", "t": " Heart of the Wildfire"}], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1562272447.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "domain": "self.boardgames", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c4mxeg/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_1_intro_and_initial/\"&gt;Part 1 - Intro and Initial Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c64wqe/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_2_creating_the_thematic/\"&gt;Part 2 - Creating the Thematic Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c7s2pn/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_3_the_first_rough_draft/\"&gt;Part 3 - The First Rough Draft and Play-Test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/cakhsi/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_5_final_iterate_iterate/\"&gt;Part 5 (Final) - Iterate, Iterate, Iterate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a few play-testing sessions and changing the design quite a bit, I decided that I was far enough along that I could write up a post for Reddit gauging the interest in a series of \u201cdiaries\u201d on what I\u2019d done thus far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also posted it on Boardgamegeek.com.

These would continue to change and fluctuate from this point all the way to the end of the balancing cycle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 5 - Growth Options:&lt;/strong&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reclaim All, Gain a Power Card -&amp;gt; Reclaim All, Gain 1 Energy, Gain Earth OR Sun&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Add a Presence (Range 3), Gain a Power Card.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Add a Presence (Range 0), Gain 2 Energy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shifting Desert isn\u2019t primarily an Earth Spirit, so I didn\u2019t want the Reclaim to be terribly strong. But it has Earth as the secondary Element, so I wanted it to be slightly better than some Reclaim All combinations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Parts 6 through 8 are for play-testing, so I\u2019m not going to go into that any more in this article.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now you\u2019ve seen how a lot of things can be revealed when play-testing what you\u2019ve created. These revelations can in turn change a lot of the design of your Spirit (especially when your fundamentals aren\u2019t in place completely).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recommend anyone who wants to make their own Spirit follow the advice given above. It makes the process more streamlined and helps to identify problems earlier in the design.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next time will be the final article where I reveal what I consider to be the (nearly) finished Spirit and give tips for how to play-test efficiently in addition to a smattering of lessons that I learned that I think will be useful to everyone else who attempts something like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": ":spirit_island: Heart of the Wildfire", "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "c922pk", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LordMotas", "num_crossposts": 1, "num_comments": 7, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/boardgames/comments/c922pk/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_4_back_to_the_drawing/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c922pk/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_4_back_to_the_drawing/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2047801, "created_utc": 1562243647.0, "discussion_type": null, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "boardgames", "selftext": "Hi everyone\n\nLast time we played a match of GoT, we decided to do a 7 player match without the Targaryen house and board to see how including the Arryn would change the original game dynamics.\n\nAs far as I remember, the manual doesn't explicitly say that you can't play as Arryn without Targaryen (it specifically says to always put the Eyrie extensor over the original game - the Essos board is only included if someone picked Targ) and I've searched on BGG/similar forums - it was universally accepted that wasn't an issue.\n\nHowever, the only thing that bothered us was their initial unit setup.

I am sure there are rules descriptions of it on YouTube if you need a refresher\n\nThis variant gives the Greater/Lesser Peons more power and makes it more fun to be on the bottom,\n\nHow to play this variant:\nIn the beginning of the game, Before Taxation,  The Greater and Lesser Peons conspire against the Great Dalmuti by picking one Jester to be the Jester of Death.  The other a Jester is called the Jester of Good Fortune.  \n\nThis is done with everyone\u2019s eyes closed except the Peons at the beginning of a round.\n\nAfter the Jester of Death has been decided play a round as normal.\n\n\nThe Jester card plays the same just like in the normal game of Dalmuti,  it\u2019s rank 13 or you can play it as an additional card just like normal.\n\nIf the Jester gets played with any card 4 or lower, it has entered the castle.\n\nJesters that have entered the castle, at the very end of the of the round activate.  \n\nIf the Jester of Death activates at the end of the round, something bad happens to the Great Dalmuti.  Here is what I was thinking.\n\n\n1. Disgrace the Greater Dalmuti ( they can never ever be Dalmuti again)\n2. Killing the Greater Dalmuti ( The Greater dalmuti is eliminated from the game)\n\n\nIf the Jester of Good fortune activates, something good happens to the dalmuti, Here is what I was thinking.\n\n1.The Greater Dalmuti ascends to the position of the Greatest Dalmuti. Which means there are 3 positions of royalty now,  Lesser dalmuti,  Great dalmuti and the Greatest Dalmuti.  (The highest merchant becomes the lesser dalmuti. Everyone else moves up, except merchants and peons)\n\n\n\nThis makes it more fun to be a Peon and adds a guessing game to the Dalmuti gameplay with additional mind games.\n\n\nNow if you made it this far thank you for reading.  \n\nI came up with a way for the royalty to shoo a Jester away before the Jesters activate.\n\nThe three cards in the game are called the Earl Marshall\u2019s.  But in this variant,  One of them is Called the Supreme Earl Marshall and this card can get rid of a Jester that has entered the castle.\n\n\nI\u2019m not sure exactly when it gets rid of a Jester that has entered the castle.\n\nMaybe after it is played?\n\nOr who ever has played the Supreme Earl Marshall, can decided whether to shoo a Jester away at the end of the Game.\n\nWhat do you think or recommend?\n\nFinal question.\n\nI\u2019m curious to hear your thoughts,  if both Jesters are in the castle at the end of the round, what happens?\n\nDoes the Dalmuti pick one (hoping he picks the Good Fortune Jester)\n\nOr do both Jesters cancel each other out.\n\nI like the Dalmuti picking one.

I am sure there are rules descriptions of it on YouTube if you need a refresher&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This variant gives the Greater/Lesser Peons more power and makes it more fun to be on the bottom,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How to play this variant:\nIn the beginning of the game, Before Taxation,  The Greater and Lesser Peons conspire against the Great Dalmuti by picking one Jester to be the Jester of Death.  The other a Jester is called the Jester of Good Fortune.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is done with everyone\u2019s eyes closed except the Peons at the beginning of a round.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the Jester of Death has been decided play a round as normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Jester card plays the same just like in the normal game of Dalmuti,  it\u2019s rank 13 or you can play it as an additional card just like normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the Jester gets played with any card 4 or lower, it has entered the castle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jesters that have entered the castle, at the very end of the of the round activate.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the Jester of Death activates at the end of the round, something bad happens to the Great Dalmuti.  Here is what I was thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Disgrace the Greater Dalmuti ( they can never ever be Dalmuti again)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Killing the Greater Dalmuti ( The Greater dalmuti is eliminated from the game)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the Jester of Good fortune activates, something good happens to the dalmuti, Here is what I was thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.The Greater Dalmuti ascends to the position of the Greatest Dalmuti. Which means there are 3 positions of royalty now,  Lesser dalmuti,  Great dalmuti and the Greatest Dalmuti.  (The highest merchant becomes the lesser dalmuti. Everyone else moves up, except merchants and peons)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This makes it more fun to be a Peon and adds a guessing game to the Dalmuti gameplay with additional mind games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now if you made it this far thank you for reading.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came up with a way for the royalty to shoo a Jester away before the Jesters activate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The three cards in the game are called the Earl Marshall\u2019s.  But in this variant,  One of them is Called the Supreme Earl Marshall and this card can get rid of a Jester that has entered the castle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m not sure exactly when it gets rid of a Jester that has entered the castle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe after it is played?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or who ever has played the Supreme Earl Marshall, can decided whether to shoo a Jester away at the end of the Game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think or recommend?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Final question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m curious to hear your thoughts,  if both Jesters are in the castle at the end of the round, what happens?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does the Dalmuti pick one (hoping he picks the Good Fortune Jester)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or do both Jesters cancel each other out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like the Dalmuti picking one.  What are your thoughts?  I am very excited to play test this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "c94x1g", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Improvology", "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/boardgames/comments/c94x1g/i_made_a_variant_to_the_great_dalmuti_would_love/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c94x1g/i_made_a_variant_to_the_great_dalmuti_would_love/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2047801, "created_utc": 1562259660.0, "discussion_type": null, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "after": "t3_c94x1g", "before": null}}
