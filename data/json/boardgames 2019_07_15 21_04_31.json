There were about 8 people chatting and waiting for 7 PM to roll around. This group meets for range of game types. Walking in I saw games like **Imperial**, **Imperial Settlers**, **Sushi Go Party**, **Manhattan Project**, **Chinatown**, **Power Grid**, and **Endeavor**.\n\nI have always wanted to try **Imperial Settlers**, so I joined with a girl, *J*, who has also never played and I believe the owner of the copy...let's call him *El*. So El breaks out all components and is explaining the empires, the expansions present, and which ones he recommended we start with. Cool. I don't know the game so I'm not picky about my empire. J got Barbarians, I got Egypt (not exactly for beginners) and he chose Japan.\n\nWe begin the teach. It isn't very organized and he is explaining *how* to play the game at a pretty brisk pace. Swords and stones and wood and razing and foundations and deals and actions and production...*UGH*. A few minutes in I ask, \"So what are we going for here?,\" asking really for our **purpose**. He stops, looks at me with impatient confusion and says, \"You're trying to get points. You're trying to get the most VP.\"\n\n\"Well yeah,\" I reply. \"I see we are going for VP. I mean what is our purpose here? What are we trying to do?\"\n\n\"You're trying to build a empire by building structures with resources that give you bonuses throughout the game,\" he forces out.\n\n\"Oohhhh!\" J and I let out in unison. The swords and stones and foundations all made much more sense! We continue on with the teach following along with considerable more ease.\n\nIt's time to complete setup. El's hands are sweeping across the table, grabbing our starting resources and placing them on our boards. J and I being new, we weren't quite sure why we got different starting resources. It had to be explained to us again. OK moving on. J is first player, chosen by that pretty neat app on El's phone that detects everyone's finger pressed on the screen and randomly chooses FP. \n\nTime to draft cards (the *Lookout Phase*). El lays out the four (3P+1) cards in front of us. Before J, the first player, can absorb what has been placed in front of her, El calls out the optimal card and suggests she takes that one. She pauses to read the other cards, but ends up choosing El's suggestion. El shifts the cards to me and calls out the next optimal card. \"You should take this one,\" and explains why it is the best option. El's brusque disposition was really starting to show here, most surely elevated from his fiery ardor for boardgames.\n\n\"Hold on a second, man. Let me see what's going on here,\" I leveled. I wanted to read these damn cards and learn what types of options we would be presented with during the game. As a learner, it's important to learn what is out there as much as it is to identify \"optimal\" cards. We draft cards in the opposite order, again experiencing El's declarations of the best cards for us before we could read and understand any of the cards placed in front of us. OK, here we go. Let's just play this game and have a good time.\n\nThe game gets going. Not long into it, I notice another antic of El's. His lower jaw is down and jutting out, chest rising and falling as air rushed into and out of his mouth, eyes piercing his cards as he studies them. The only thing missing was a caption hanging below his head: *[Heavy breathing intensifies]*. This dude *loves* this game. As J and I place cards down, El's eyes get locked on our cards as they are laid. He identifies the cards the instant he sees the front, and is again declaring to us what they mean, what we get, even which side to place the cards, and as I slide the card into place, all my resources earned have already been placed in my tableau.\n\nThe game goes on like this. El is moving our resources around, taking what we intend to spend and grabbing what we intend to take. His hands are in our tableau as much as he is spending in his. A few times I had to motion my hands in an attempt to slow him down and allow me to *think* through my own damn options. I didn't score as well as they did come game end. I owe part of that due to refusing to play his suggestions out of my own frustration from his intrusive \"facilitation\" of the game. I didn't have that great of a time and I likely will avoid his table from this point on.\n\nSo to my boardgame community I say, it's fine if your heart rate climbs when you hear that cardboard fart when opening up your favorite game. It is certainly a good thing to show the world all the awesome games it has never played. But fuck me, if you want them to have a good time and you want to ensure they know *how*--and want--to play the game next time around, get your damn hands off their tokens and game pieces, know when to bite your tongue and let them think--and act--for themselves (unless they are struggling or ask), and *let. them. fucking. play.*\n\nFunny enough, I vented to my partner and he immediately reminded me of how he had to tell me in the past not to place my hands in any way on his side of the table due to pretty much the same reasons. So I am guilty too, but I'm more woke now following that game night. I will make every effort to allow newbies to a game their own physical and mental space for maximum enjoyment. Thanks for reading.\n\n**Edit:** I'll acknowledge the personal element here and say that it isn't necessary for my testimony. I'll leave it in here for readers' reference but I will admit it wasn't necessary to convey my main message. I was trying to paint a picture, and I chose the wrong way to do it. El, you showed up in this thread. I apologize for the personal attack, but my message still stands. I don't think that should change now that you saw this post. Like I said, a lot of us are guilty in letting our excitement get the best of us, and it may become overbearing to others when we forget to slow down and let new players truly experience the game. I, particularly, enjoy the try-fail-experiment-succeed element of learning a game. I don't want to know the best move, I want to learn my way there. I think some here will identify with that. It just wasn't a good pairing of teacher-learner styles and thought I'd offer to the community, by example, a teaching style that is adverse to the learners' experience.", "author_fullname": "t2_4qb7c", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Give a man a meeple and he plays for a day...

She pauses to read the other cards, but ends up choosing El&amp;#39;s suggestion. El shifts the cards to me and calls out the next optimal card. &amp;quot;You should take this one,&amp;quot; and explains why it is the best option. El&amp;#39;s brusque disposition was really starting to show here, most surely elevated from his fiery ardor for boardgames.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hold on a second, man. Let me see what&amp;#39;s going on here,&amp;quot; I leveled. I wanted to read these damn cards and learn what types of options we would be presented with during the game. As a learner, it&amp;#39;s important to learn what is out there as much as it is to identify &amp;quot;optimal&amp;quot; cards. We draft cards in the opposite order, again experiencing El&amp;#39;s declarations of the best cards for us before we could read and understand any of the cards placed in front of us. OK, here we go. Let&amp;#39;s just play this game and have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game gets going. Not long into it, I notice another antic of El&amp;#39;s. His lower jaw is down and jutting out, chest rising and falling as air rushed into and out of his mouth, eyes piercing his cards as he studies them. The only thing missing was a caption hanging below his head: &lt;em&gt;[Heavy breathing intensifies]&lt;/em&gt;. This dude &lt;em&gt;loves&lt;/em&gt; this game. As J and I place cards down, El&amp;#39;s eyes get locked on our cards as they are laid. He identifies the cards the instant he sees the front, and is again declaring to us what they mean, what we get, even which side to place the cards, and as I slide the card into place, all my resources earned have already been placed in my tableau.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game goes on like this. El is moving our resources around, taking what we intend to spend and grabbing what we intend to take. His hands are in our tableau as much as he is spending in his. A few times I had to motion my hands in an attempt to slow him down and allow me to &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; through my own damn options. I didn&amp;#39;t score as well as they did come game end. I owe part of that due to refusing to play his suggestions out of my own frustration from his intrusive &amp;quot;facilitation&amp;quot; of the game. I didn&amp;#39;t have that great of a time and I likely will avoid his table from this point on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to my boardgame community I say, it&amp;#39;s fine if your heart rate climbs when you hear that cardboard fart when opening up your favorite game. It is certainly a good thing to show the world all the awesome games it has never played. But fuck me, if you want them to have a good time and you want to ensure they know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;--and want--to play the game next time around, get your damn hands off their tokens and game pieces, know when to bite your tongue and let them think--and act--for themselves (unless they are struggling or ask), and &lt;em&gt;let. them. fucking. play.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Funny enough, I vented to my partner and he immediately reminded me of how he had to tell me in the past not to place my hands in any way on his side of the table due to pretty much the same reasons. So I am guilty too, but I&amp;#39;m more woke now following that game night. I will make every effort to allow newbies to a game their own physical and mental space for maximum enjoyment. Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;ll acknowledge the personal element here and say that it isn&amp;#39;t necessary for my testimony. I&amp;#39;ll leave it in here for readers&amp;#39; reference but I will admit it wasn&amp;#39;t necessary to convey my main message. I was trying to paint a picture, and I chose the wrong way to do it. El, you showed up in this thread. I apologize for the personal attack, but my message still stands. I don&amp;#39;t think that should change now that you saw this post. Like I said, a lot of us are guilty in letting our excitement get the best of us, and it may become overbearing to others when we forget to slow down and let new players truly experience the game. I, particularly, enjoy the try-fail-experiment-succeed element of learning a game. I don&amp;#39;t want to know the best move, I want to learn my way there. I think some here will identify with that. It just wasn&amp;#39;t a good pairing of teacher-learner styles and thought I&amp;#39;d offer to the community, by example, a teaching style that is adverse to the learners&amp;#39; experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "c6qjf8", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Nohomobutimgay", "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 23, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/boardgames/comments/c6qjf8/give_a_man_a_meeple_and_he_plays_for_a_day_a/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c6qjf8/give_a_man_a_meeple_and_he_plays_for_a_day_a/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2047801, "created_utc": 1561759955.0, "discussion_type": null, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "boardgames", "selftext": "[I've got it all set up.](https://i.imgur.com/cuqp6zb.jpg) Any tips?  \nUpdate: The whole game came down to two players and whoever could score a 2 point objective first.

His trademark games comprise multiple yet simple scoring systems ('point salads' to some), but the games revolve around mechanisms that limit the available options on any player's given turn. Therefore, players focus on action manipulation and managing flexibility. Anyway, here is my list. I know a few highly rated titles did not make it. Happy to see your list!\n\n\\#10. **Aquasphere** \\- an interesting mix of rondel and delayed action selection. It's one of the more cutthroat Feld games as there is area control scoring and you can bump other players' pieces back to reduce their scoring opportunity.\n\n\\#9. **Macao** \\- a simple yet brilliant design. Select coloured dice with pip value N, giving you N cubes of that colour N rounds from now. Any unused cubes on a round are lost. Would have been a higher place if the scoring is more exciting and the rulebook is better written.\n\n\\#8. **Carpe Diem -** the latest design on this list. The gameplay is simple, place a tile from a central market onto your board to earn bonuses and end game points for completed features. The round-to-round scoring is interesting: every round you must fulfil two adjacent scoring objectives on a randomised grid. Failing to do so results in losing points. It's a game about managing flexibility.  \n\n\\#7. **Notre Dame -** A card drafting game in which everyone starts with the same deck so you have a bit of control over what your neighbours can do. It's very smooth and the expansion added more variability.\n\n\\#6. **Bora Bora** \\- a worker placement using dice. Higher number offers more powerful actions but a lower number blocks out a worker placement spot for any comparatively higher numbers. Very tight and sometimes brutal.\n\n\\#5. **Trajan -** Move cogs clockwise around a mancala and do the action corresponding to the final place you drop off a cog. It rewards planning ahead your next 5+ moves. Used to be higher on the list but perhaps I've played it too many times. \n\n\\#4. **The Speicherstadt**  / Jorvik - The game of queuing. Queue up to buy a card, where the price equals the number of people in that queue.  Queue earlier for a better chance of getting what you want (sometimes at a steep price) and queue later to spite your opponents (or maybe end up get something cheap!). One of the most interactive Feld games and the length hits a sweet spot.\n\n\\#3. **Luna -** a perfect information game. This is about positioning your workers at the right place at the right time. A brilliant mix of short term tactics and long term strategy.\n\n\\#2. **Bruges -** a game of multi-use cards. Highly replayable especially with the expansion. Satisfying when you pull off combos or outwit your opponents on one of the majority scoring.\n\n\\#1. **Castles of Burgundy -** no surprises here.

I'd really like to hear what people think of it, and if there's an audience for these kind of themed collated micro reviews:*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs tabletop gaming has started to gain newfound traction, with fans flocking to Kickstarter to express their support, the want for \u2018more stuff\u2019 is increasing in demand. Gloomhaven, for example, rose to the highest rank of BoardGameGeek by fulfilling the promise of a dungeon-crawling campaign that could take literally years to complete.\n\nSmaller, bitesize cardboard experiences may not be quite as complex or immersive as their expansive big-boy-box counterparts, but there are some that manage to be incredibly rewarding, without requiring you to sacrifice an entire evening for the pleasure.\n\nIn the first of this series of collated board game micro-reviews, I want to look at a few games both big and small that attempt to strike a delicate balance between content and engagement, for those who want to be as efficient as possible with their tabletop time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**BIG - Star Wars: Rebellion**\n\nNever trust a board game by its suggested playtime. I have failed to heed my own advice too many times when bringing this game to the table. 2-4 hours seems like all the time this cat-and-mouse race through space should need, what could possibly go wrong? \n\nOne player or team of two takes command of the massively overpowered Empire, attempting to locate and blow up the Rebel Base, controlled by the Rebels, who are simply trying to survive. There\u2019s a set amount of rounds in the game, which the Rebels can reduce by completing special objectives, but there\u2019s such a variety of cool-sounding things to do every round that it can take an exceedingly long time to plan and execute. \n\nWhile the thinking-phase of the game can vary in length depending on player experience, the combat is a persistent drag. Despite being logistically simple, the sheer amount of fiddliness with tokens and identifying damage done based on the colour of the die rolled means that it frequently brings the game to a grinding halt. That said, the asymmetric design of the game is relatively flawless: the Rebels have weaker forces but are able to constantly undermine the Empire, who struggle to pin them down despite their strength in numbers. This tension aptly matches the tone of the conflict in the Star Wars universe.\n\nVerdict: Rebellion is relatively easy to pick up and play, but the brainpower required to outwit your opponent can too often result in epics that take longer to resolve than a trilogy of films. For everything there is to love about the vast majority of the experience, it can\u2019t help but feel like a slog by the end. The combat definitely doesn\u2019t help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SMALL - Love Letter**\n\nLike the early seasons of Game of Thrones, this isn\u2019t about thrilling battles, epic dragons, and illogical plot developments - this is about sordid romantic conspiracies and tactical masterminds deceiving their allies to distract from what\u2019s hidden up their sleeve.\n\nAs a player you attempt to unveil and eliminate all other possible suitors of a princess until one lover is left standing, or by ending a round with the closest connection to the princess (a.k.a holding the highest number card). You only have two cards available to use on your turn, each with a number value and a special effect that can either help or hinder.\n\nThe challenge of this game is avoiding letting others learn the contents of your hand, as that is the easiest way to secure a rival\u2019s elimination. There are no opportunities for temporary allegiances, meaning no one can be trusted at any time. Instead, this game allows you to expose how your friends behave when smuggling the truth under pressure.\n\nVerdict: This game has been tough to recommend to friends, despite it\u2019s 5-15 minute playtime, because the rules don\u2019t seem as easy as other compact experiences. But whenever I can convince a group to give it a go, it\u2019s great for testing your mates\u2019 poker faces, and fun for anyone who enjoys some simple sexy subterfuge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**BIG - Gloomhaven**\n\nThis is a mammoth game that succeeds at taking players on a sprawling campaign featuring a unique and engaging selection of playable classes, varied yet easy-to-learn mechanics, and inventive ways of repurposing a vast core set of components. There are so many boards, props, minions, etc, that the game can be a challenge to setup and initially organise, but these many different parts ensure that no two games are the same.\n\nYou are part of a Guild trying to survive in the city of Gloomhaven and the surrounding wilds. Over the course of 100 or so missions (with objectives such as \u2018kill all monsters on the board\u2019 or \u2018escort the NPC from one corner of the board to another), players create and retire several characters as they follow a non-linear story in a world that gradually reveals itself. This is the closest thing to D\u2019n\u2019D in a box, without the need for a GM.\n\nThe overarching player/character development feels like a video game as you upgrade abilities, make moral choices, and find more loot, while the main gameplay is a cross between cooperative card gaming and strategic turn-based combat. This is all confined to scenarios that individually won\u2019t take more than an hour or two to complete, without requiring much commitment from occasional players. The story isn\u2019t going to win any awards, but it is satisfyingly fun context for any guild of adventurers.\n\nVerdict: I have invested more time into this game than any other, with more than half of the content remaining locked to me. If you can find a way to ease the process of setup, this is a game that you will want to bring back to the table to continue your adventures, with a flexibility of playtime that can last an entire day or just a couple of hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SMALL - Exploding Kittens**\n\nAnother Kickstarter success story, this game is about as brief as a game of Russian Roulette, and just as intense... well, almost. Exploding Kittens is about luck, screwing other people over, and avoiding the ever-present threat of sudden death by fiery feline.\n\nIn the Oatmeal\u2019s tabletop debut, you either win or you die. On a turn, you play as many cards as you wish before ending your go by drawing a card. If that card happens to be an Exploding Kitten, you\u2019re out of the game unless you have the means to defuse it.\n\nA simple concept that carves out easy conflict between you and your competitors as everyone tries to avoid drawing cards, especially if all players suspect that a recently defused kitten might have been returned to the top of the deck by a near-\u2018sploded player.\n\nVerdict: This is the preferred choice by most of my friends as the easiest game to get out for a quick game or several. It\u2019s a refreshing outlet for friends to take turns at attacking one another while trying to turn the increasingly unlikely odds in their favour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**BIG - Batman: Gotham City Chronicles**\n\nThis game and its jam-packed expansions can easily total a small fortune for anyone who wants to invest in the full collection. It\u2019s incredibly immersive and wonderfully detailed for any DC fan, but that comes at the cost of time-consuming complexity. Surely this is the perfect case in point for my argument - that perhaps less is more and we need to refrain from buying into these deliciously complex collections of combat-ready figurines.\n\nIn a single game, one player takes the mantle of the villains, while the others each pick a hero and proceed to complete specific objectives. All of the characters and scenarios have their own features and contextual effects, to create an excessively detailed world for friends to showdown within. It really is a smorgasbord of delights for any dark knight fan.\n\nConsidering how many rules apply to the vast array of playable characters and scenarios available in the base game alone, it\u2019s hard to say whether it would take longer to learn the game than the estimated 4 hours required to play a scenario. Not to mention that each playable character requires learning an relatively unique skill set prior to each game and, unlike Gloomhaven, these missions don\u2019t contribute to a grander narrative.\n\nThen again... this is the only streamlined Batman tabletop experience outside of the even more elaborate Batman Miniatures Game. For some, that alone might be worth it.\n\nVerdict: I don\u2019t know if I can recommend it. But I know that I want it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SMALL - Munchkin**\n\nMunchkin offers a deluxe edition with a board that serves as a basic visual guide, but really this is a compact tabletop card game that proves you don\u2019t need endless pieces of plastic for an adequate adventure with satisfying competition and character development.\n\nYour goal is to reach level 10. To gain a level, you must defeat a monster. The game encourages strategy and conversation by giving you the option to work with or against each other. Players can either assist you in combat, in exchange for a share of the rewards, or they might side with the monsters to make life even harder for you\n\nThis game manages to maintain the depth of a classic dungeon crawler and strip out all the faff thanks to its reliance on a simple card-based system to create a variety of quick encounters and with rewards that progress your character. The experience is designed to give players a taste of what pen-and-paper RPGs consist of, in only a fraction of the time.\n\nVerdict: A perfectly compact excerpt of what players desire from classic RPGs without unnecessary role-playing and fiddliness, which can be started and wrapped up within the same hour, or played on repeat for a satisfying full evening of dungeoneering.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**IN CONCLUSION (the long and short of it)**\n\nThere are stark differences between long hefty tabletop experiences and their condensed counterparts, as well as the types of audiences they specifically appeal to. Games that last several hours are typically tests of endurance and brainpower, testing players logistical ability to evolve their strategies based on the way the opponent is developing. Despite the draw of these exhaustive games to experienced players, the games that stand the test of time and get brought back to the table are those that respect your time, allow you to improve your skills, and provide unique experiences with each new game.\n\nWhereas the games that last several hours absolutely require that you are with a group of people that are equally as committed to playing as you are, shorter games are great for playing with people you want to know better, or want to gauge the interest of before proposing an 8 hour Twilight Imperium Campaign. The best of these will expose something about the deeper personalities of the people around you in a microcosm, with the real challenge being how you read other players rather than rebut their actions. They are often perfect ice breakers or time-fillers for social occasions with friends and strangers alike, rather than being the sole focus of an entire evening (or longer).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*www.smasters.net/tabletalk*", "author_fullname": "t2_wiv3s", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "TableTalk: Is Bigger Always Better?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Review"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "review", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_c6nnwc", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Review", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1561759396.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1561774891.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 6, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.boardgames", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is my first attempt at reviewing boardgames and at writing for a blog. I&amp;#39;d really like to hear what people think of it, and if there&amp;#39;s an audience for these kind of themed collated micro reviews:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As tabletop gaming has started to gain newfound traction, with fans flocking to Kickstarter to express their support, the want for \u2018more stuff\u2019 is increasing in demand. Gloomhaven, for example, rose to the highest rank of BoardGameGeek by fulfilling the promise of a dungeon-crawling campaign that could take literally years to complete.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Smaller, bitesize cardboard experiences may not be quite as complex or immersive as their expansive big-boy-box counterparts, but there are some that manage to be incredibly rewarding, without requiring you to sacrifice an entire evening for the pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the first of this series of collated board game micro-reviews, I want to look at a few games both big and small that attempt to strike a delicate balance between content and engagement, for those who want to be as efficient as possible with their tabletop time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIG - Star Wars: Rebellion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never trust a board game by its suggested playtime. I have failed to heed my own advice too many times when bringing this game to the table. 2-4 hours seems like all the time this cat-and-mouse race through space should need, what could possibly go wrong? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One player or team of two takes command of the massively overpowered Empire, attempting to locate and blow up the Rebel Base, controlled by the Rebels, who are simply trying to survive. There\u2019s a set amount of rounds in the game, which the Rebels can reduce by completing special objectives, but there\u2019s such a variety of cool-sounding things to do every round that it can take an exceedingly long time to plan and execute. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While the thinking-phase of the game can vary in length depending on player experience, the combat is a persistent drag. Despite being logistically simple, the sheer amount of fiddliness with tokens and identifying damage done based on the colour of the die rolled means that it frequently brings the game to a grinding halt. That said, the asymmetric design of the game is relatively flawless: the Rebels have weaker forces but are able to constantly undermine the Empire, who struggle to pin them down despite their strength in numbers. This tension aptly matches the tone of the conflict in the Star Wars universe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Verdict: Rebellion is relatively easy to pick up and play, but the brainpower required to outwit your opponent can too often result in epics that take longer to resolve than a trilogy of films. For everything there is to love about the vast majority of the experience, it can\u2019t help but feel like a slog by the end. The combat definitely doesn\u2019t help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SMALL - Love Letter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like the early seasons of Game of Thrones, this isn\u2019t about thrilling battles, epic dragons, and illogical plot developments - this is about sordid romantic conspiracies and tactical masterminds deceiving their allies to distract from what\u2019s hidden up their sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a player you attempt to unveil and eliminate all other possible suitors of a princess until one lover is left standing, or by ending a round with the closest connection to the princess (a.k.a holding the highest number card). You only have two cards available to use on your turn, each with a number value and a special effect that can either help or hinder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The challenge of this game is avoiding letting others learn the contents of your hand, as that is the easiest way to secure a rival\u2019s elimination. There are no opportunities for temporary allegiances, meaning no one can be trusted at any time. Instead, this game allows you to expose how your friends behave when smuggling the truth under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Verdict: This game has been tough to recommend to friends, despite it\u2019s 5-15 minute playtime, because the rules don\u2019t seem as easy as other compact experiences. But whenever I can convince a group to give it a go, it\u2019s great for testing your mates\u2019 poker faces, and fun for anyone who enjoys some simple sexy subterfuge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIG - Gloomhaven&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a mammoth game that succeeds at taking players on a sprawling campaign featuring a unique and engaging selection of playable classes, varied yet easy-to-learn mechanics, and inventive ways of repurposing a vast core set of components.
