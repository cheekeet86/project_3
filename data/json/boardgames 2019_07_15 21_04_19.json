A number have been brought to the market in English editions, and that what has happened here with [**Long Live the Queen**](http://ludicreations.com/product/long-live-queen-classic-edition/). This clever two player game was originally published in Japan by Circle3D6. With the help of LudiCreations, it was finally brought to a wider audience with the help of a crowd-funded project that produced two editions: one that retained the Japanese art and theme, and a second version that used the diesel-punk theme of another LudiCreations game. There were other component changes as well, including larger tiles, a revised graphic design, plus expanded rules and some other new components that would help with the game-play. The result was a clever two-player game with a choice of two fine editions.  I opted to get the version with the Japanese styled art, so that's what I'll primarily be describing, but the game-play is identical with the diesel-punk version.\n\n**Overview**\n\nIn Long Live the Queen, two players go head-to-head in a tactical game where they each play one of the queen's two daughters. Now that the queen has died, we must seek to persuade the members of the court to support our quest to become the new queen. To do that, we need to cleverly make use of our court personnel.  Both players have a line of 11 face-down characters opposite each other, corresponding to the possible outcomes of rolling two standard dice. The dice then activate the characters: those corresponding to the rolled number are flipped face up, or their abilities trigger.  \n\nThere are two different ways to win, either by being the first to get three of each prestige token, or by eliminating the opponent's princess.  Triggering the special abilities of our characters will get us the prestige we need in three main areas: might (red), wealth (yellow), and wisdom (blue). Alternatively, using our Assassin or Sniper on our competitor princess will also gain us victory. These two paths to victory are reasonably balanced, with a prestige win being more common, but your strategy will also depend on how your opponent plays.  In the inevitable tactical battle and see-saw struggle that will follow, will our princess come out on top, and become the next queen?\n\n**Impressions**\n\nLudiCreations have done an excellent job of bringing Long Live the Queen to English speaking audiences, and to a wider market. While coming up with a new theme and artwork, they have made the sensible choice of preserving the original anime style artwork as well, so that consumers can make their own choice about which they prefer. Certainly the components are excellent, with sturdy cardboard tiles and attractive dice being part of the package, along with wonderful artwork that I can't praise highly enough.\n\nAs for the game-play, it's a fine two player game which does exactly what it sets out to do, which is serve as a fast and highly tactical filler game with a light feel. Granted, it won't be everyone's cup of tea, and the amount of luck was the major reason why some didn't enjoy the game. Granted, the dice do play a significant role in determining the outcome - but that's to be expected in most games involving dice. But that doesn't mean that there are no meaningful decisions. The choices that you make, especially in how you arrange your characters, are still very important, and more often than not will determine the winner.\n\nEach turn you also have opportunity to switch two of your adjacent tiles, or substitute which will be your \"Master\" ability that determines what your two \"Apprentice\" tiles do. So the overall positional set-up you opt for at the start of your game, and how you manipulate it during the game, is critical. The location of your Guard - which can protect your princess - is also very important. Two other very important tiles are the Assassin and Sniper, since these can take your opponent's characters out of action. Alternatively, you can focus on an income generating strategy that revolves around earning prestige chips before your opponent does. Whatever your strategy, it's certainly not purely random, because how your characters relate positionally with respect to each other and to your opponent will often prove decisive, even though you will still need to roll the right numbers.\n\nSome players reported that the game dragged, and our first game felt like this a little too. But once you're familiar with the characters and their respective abilities, the game moves along quite nicely, and the length feels about right given how light the game actually is. Just try not to take too long about which characters to move at the end of your turn. You still need luck to be on your side to win, but clever play will make a difference. And given how quick the game can play, having the outcome influenced by luck is quite acceptable.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nIn the end, Long Live the  Queen will especially please those looking for a light two player game, and who enjoy a sharply tactical and positional game with some secret information that gives scope for bluffing, while at the same time allowing a generous amount of luck courtesy of the dice. Imagine combining the positional feel of Chess, with the tactical bluffing of Stratego, and the dice rolling of Catan. Now wrap it all up into a gorgeous package with unique artwork, and give it the feel and length of a filler. That's effectively what you get with Long Live the Queen. I for one am very pleased that LudiCreations has helped bring this fun and fast two-player game out of Japan, and shared it with the rest of the world.\n\n***Where to get it?*** *Long Live the Queen is available from the publisher LudiCreations (*[*Classic Edition*](http://ludicreations.com/product/long-live-queen-classic-edition/) *or* [*Dieselpunk Edition*](http://ludicreations.com/product/long-live-queen-dieselpunk-edition/)*)*.", "author_fullname": "t2_1k126tck", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Impressions of Long Live The Queen from LudiCreations and Japan", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Review"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "review", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_c7o7sd", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Review", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1561956358.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1561984893.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 6, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.boardgames", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years there has been a real interest in Japanese games.

We had four players but I think you can do 3-6. Each player started with a hand of cards, maybe 5 or 6. There was a mat/board where cards could be discarded/staged. I believe the object of the game was to run out of cards, but I might be wrong. It had a medieval/magic/pastoral type theme. Different cards had different values/abilities and could affect the other players, like causing them to lose a turn or pick up additional cards from the deck, kind of like UNO, but it was more strategic than that.  There wasn't combat per se, but I seem to recall that certain character cards had advantages over others in certain scenarios.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would describe it as a cross between Risk and UNO, with some Magic thrown in for good measure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny idea what I'm talking about? If I had to guess, this game came out in the last 10-15 years. I have looked all over Amazon and my local game store.  Thanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I remembered some more details about the gameplay. At the beginning of each player's turn, you get to decide what card(s) to use, I don't recall any dice but there is an element where each card has a certain value (say 3 or 5) and you can use up to a maximum value (say 10) on any turn with any combination of cards. Again, I think the object of the game is discard your entire hand.\n\nEDIT! I'm pretty sure it's **Dominion**, but I'm not sure what edition.\n\nActually, I'm positive, it was Dominion. Thanks all for the help!\n\n[https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion)", "author_fullname": "t2_dkoy57n", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Need help remembering strategy card game", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_c7hakl", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1561924367.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1561945514.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.boardgames", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, a few years ago I played this game at a party and really liked it, now I don&amp;#39;t remember the name of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was turn-based. We had four players but I think you can do 3-6. Each player started with a hand of cards, maybe 5 or 6. There was a mat/board where cards could be discarded/staged. I believe the object of the game was to run out of cards, but I might be wrong. It had a medieval/magic/pastoral type theme. Different cards had different values/abilities and could affect the other players, like causing them to lose a turn or pick up additional cards from the deck, kind of like UNO, but it was more strategic than that.  There wasn&amp;#39;t combat per se, but I seem to recall that certain character cards had advantages over others in certain scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would describe it as a cross between Risk and UNO, with some Magic thrown in for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any idea what I&amp;#39;m talking about? If I had to guess, this game came out in the last 10-15 years. I have looked all over Amazon and my local game store.
