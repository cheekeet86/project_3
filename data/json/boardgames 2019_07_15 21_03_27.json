Played some games off and on with housemates for a while but really got into it around the time I got married. I grew up with the basic, luck-based board games of the 80's and I do still have a few of those in the collection.\n\n*Organization:*\n\nI have two Kallax 4x4 shelving cubes from IKEA. Games that fit in those cubes go in there and I usually try to fit similarly-sized boxes together. I like to have one heavy game on the bottom with a few lighter games stacked on top to maximize space without causing box damage. I also try to keep games and their expansions (when I'm actively using the expansion box) together. I also have a small plastic bin that has stuff like little card games and things like that on the bottom of the shelving unit, along with some expansion boxes I've kept for some reason.\n\nAlso, most of the stuff on the bottom shelf is stuff that I don't care about losing if the basement ever gets water in it. Games that are too big for the cubed shelving go on top.\n\n*Favorite games I own:*\n\nMy current favorites would be:\n\n* 7 Wonders\n* Pandemic (in most of its iterations)\n* Splendor\n* Dominion (on top of the unit in the white cardboard box)\n* Lanterns\n* Alhambra\n\nMy wife and I discovered early on when dating (around 9 years ago, for reference) that we liked games, but we had the problem that usually one person was vastly better at a game than the other, which took some of the fun out of the game for us. Rather than let our shared hobby falter, I went on the hunt for a game we could both enjoy and remembered being briefly introduced to a game called Pandemic. I went out and found a copy. I taught the game to her and we were instantly hooked as she was thrilled with the idea that co-operative games actually existed. We've easily played Pandemic over a thousand times, starting from the original box (not stored on the shelf but instead off in general storage as we played that board and those cards to near death) up through most of its current themes. We typically play the game with open-hand and with each person controlling two characters (we found 4 player setups to be the most enjoyable to us). I can safely say that Pandemic is one of \"our things\" and provided us a great forum to get to know each other.\n\n*Games I dislike:*\n\nWe were given the Lord of the Rings themed games in the upper right that I don't particularly care for. I don't care much for Monopoly anymore, but as a kid, I loved the game and was given a fairly nice copy of it, so I keep it around.\n\n*Wishlist:*\n\nI like games like Ascension and Race for the Galaxy, but my wife hates them, so I haven't been willing to pull the trigger on them since my friends who like those games play them. I'd like to finish off our Zombies collection ad my wife and I enjoy that game and, after moving, now have sufficient space to properly play it. I also know there is an expansion for Pandemic: the Cure that I need to get my hands on.\n\n*Want to play:*\n\nWe haven't gotten 7 Wonders: Duel or Pandemic Legacy: Season 2 (NO SPOILERS) to the table yet as my wife needed a break from gaming for a while. Terra Mystica is another one I haven't yet gotten to the table. Dominion is also a game I want to play more but can be hard for me to get to the table.\n\n*Unique Items:*\n\nThe Monopoly version I own is the 60th-anniversary version and it has a bunch of nice pieces, a sleek board, and a well-designed tray. It was definitely a triple-digit purchase my family made when I was a kid back in the early 90's, so I like to keep it around as a reminder of my family supporting me in a hobby they didn't care much for.\n\nMy wife brought a few unique games to the collection. She was born in the USA but has direct family in Germany, so she's acquired a few German games. \n\n*What I like best about the hobby:*\n\nI like getting people together and just having a good time playing games, be it a co-op game or a highly competitive game. Fortunately, my group is a good mix of both types of gamers, so we get to a wide variety of games.", "author_fullname": "t2_e6ume", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Finally Got a Proper Game Shelf [COMC]", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "COMC"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "COMC", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_calu3i", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 26, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "COMC", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 26, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1562625449.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 6, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.boardgames", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collection Links: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/3muzgOo.jpg\"&gt;Entire Collection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/DnOxRia.jpg\"&gt;Left Side&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/qxvaxdV.jpg\"&gt;Right Side&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How long have you been playing:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been more serious about building a collection for 5-6 years now.

Fortunately, my group is a good mix of both types of gamers, so we get to a wide variety of games.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/G5Hl9_MGhImyGrjxHEt_pp9ScLfkyIZG6DEG5pdWoYQ.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=8b9bd05052b48fa132355a0eaca05809f46aa2ed", "width": 4032, "height": 3024}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/G5Hl9_MGhImyGrjxHEt_pp9ScLfkyIZG6DEG5pdWoYQ.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f330064cf77e078ab24e310c302380c363fc6e66", "width": 108, "height": 81}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/G5Hl9_MGhImyGrjxHEt_pp9ScLfkyIZG6DEG5pdWoYQ.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ba6d1d11ec15f92ef108fa922abbc8e2a97bb14", "width": 216, "height": 162}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/G5Hl9_MGhImyGrjxHEt_pp9ScLfkyIZG6DEG5pdWoYQ.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14f793be0b589cab043978e960aa4f75f6617efe", "width": 320, "height": 240}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/G5Hl9_MGhImyGrjxHEt_pp9ScLfkyIZG6DEG5pdWoYQ.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8651afbd020c8b14cb132a7c7c4e07135ea56b01", "width": 640, "height": 480}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/G5Hl9_MGhImyGrjxHEt_pp9ScLfkyIZG6DEG5pdWoYQ.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9281ffdbd961869ec39cbe028cb37a7c8922fe42", "width": 960, "height": 720}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/G5Hl9_MGhImyGrjxHEt_pp9ScLfkyIZG6DEG5pdWoYQ.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb60830abef8fdb31ad8f10d05c4651f65c3a5f0", "width": 1080, "height": 810}], "variants": {}, "id": "SXnkzAuK5dK_NMA_AGn9MesDaia0LowYKLiNjFy5l0c"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "734914a6-426b-11e8-8511-0e863647358e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "calu3i", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Sir_Stash", "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 22, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/boardgames/comments/calu3i/finally_got_a_proper_game_shelf_comc/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/calu3i/finally_got_a_proper_game_shelf_comc/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2047801, "created_utc": 1562596649.0, "discussion_type": null, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "boardgames", "selftext": "(*Eric: I agree to the terms for creating Spirit Island game elements* [*set forth in the FAQ*](https://querki.net/u/darker/spirit-island-faq/#!.9v5ka4u)*.)*\n\n[Part 1 - Intro and Initial Research](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c4mxeg/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_1_intro_and_initial/)\n\n[Part 2 - Creating the Thematic Design](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c64wqe/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_2_creating_the_thematic/)\n\n[Part 3 - The First Rough Draft and Play-Test](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c7s2pn/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_3_the_first_rough_draft/)\n\n[Part 4 - Back to the Drawing Board](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c922pk/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_4_back_to_the_drawing/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward from the previous article all the way to now. Using the design pattern from the designer/developers as well as a TON of play-testing, here is the current state of [Shifting Desert\u2019s Gaping Maw](https://imgur.com/a/ctU3DUf).\n\nAs you can see, a lot has changed. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of how things got to the point that they are now:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Special Rules (Part 2):**\n\nObviously I removed the Special Rule about Gathering whenever I placed a Presence. It was definitely too much and needed to go.\n\nAs suggested by another user over on the Spirit Island subreddit (credit: /u/desocupad0 ), I shifted directions a bit with the design. It was stated that even though the Spirit was thematically based on devouring and gathering, I was dealing Damage with my Innate Power rather than simply using the Destroy keyword. Similar \u201cdesert\u201d cards (such as Drought) simply Destroy large amounts of buildings, but add Blight. I decided to embrace this idea and build the Spirit around these mechanics. As a result, Blight does not cascade where Shifting Desert has a Sacred Site.\n\nI also revised the conversion of Energy to Sun as well. As much as I wanted it to work, I found that in that iteration of the Spirit I was always spending Energy to reach thresholds and ended up being starved the entire game. It didn\u2019t feel good, so I abandoned the idea of wanting to hit ten Sun Elements in one Innate Power. Instead, the current Special Rule simply adds a Sun (max of 2) where you have Sacred Sites. So as long as you have 2 (which shouldn\u2019t be hard for Shifting Desert) you\u2019ll be able to reach a lot of your thresholds. The limit is two so that it's balanced around the solo game and doesn't get out of control with more players.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Innate Powers (Part 3):**\n\n*The Ravenous Hunger Devours*\n\nThis Power revealed time and time again that it was too hard to hit the later Elemental thresholds even late into the game, that was a problem. It's still something that I'm working with, but it will get there in time. It was decided that Shifting Desert was primarily a Spirit of the Sun rather than Earth, so that shifted things around a bit. One iteration of the Innate Power had an extra threshold on the ability to add one extra range. It came from the fact that Shifting Desert couldn't deal with Cities that aren\u2019t built in the Sands. It felt as though I was trying to make it plausible to deal with everything when that's not what balance means. So I offloaded some of that power into one of the Unique Power Cards and that allowed me to remove it from this Innate Power. I also changed the Damage the Innate Power was doing simply because twelve was definitely too much, and we couldn\u2019t ever get that much health into a Sands location in any of our play-tests either. As was mentioned previously, it was brought to my attention that most desert-based Powers simply destroy buildings and don't worry about Damage values. So I modified the Innate Power to work similarly.\n\n*Mirage Leads to Certain Demise*\n\nYeah, it was really busted the iteration I showed off in third article as well. Repeating a Gather effect even once is really powerful. Gathering two Explorers really makes the game a cakewalk in the early game which leads to a nearly non-existent or non-threatening late game. The current version is easy to Gather one, but Gathering more than one takes effort and by that time it doesn't make the game trivial.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Unique Powers (Part 4):**\n\n*Scorch With Desert Heat*\n\nSomehow I\u2019m surprised that this one stayed relatively the same for the longest time in its purest form. It just felt good once I made it match how Flash Flood works for River Surges. With the mention of a theme change (Damage to Destroy) it didn't take much to modify this Power. It allows for some good choices, it's an effective Power assuming you don't use it terribly and destroy lots of Dahan with it. Really liking how this one feels.\n\n*Revitalizing Oasis*\n\nI wanted a way for Desert to deal with adding the Blight that it did, so this was the solution. It has a use outside of clearing out Blight and it feels good to use. I like the conditional having two Dahan so that the Blight removal isn't free. For now it's in a good place.\n\n*Bury In Tombs Of Sand*\n\nThis Power allows for some flexibility when wanting to Destroy just one Town or being and to deal with them just outside of your range.\n\n*Blinding Sandstorms*\n\nA defensive Power. There's not too much going on here. It incentivizes placing lots of Presence in the same location. I like how it feels, I'll probably need to tweak the numbers a little more since it feels like it Defends just a bit too much sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Growth Options (Part 5)**\n\nThings changed a bit here. I went looking at River Surges and Thunderspeaker for guidance, since they seemed (to me) to be Spirits of the Sun as well. After taking a break from Shifting Desert and playing a few games of River, I learned that I really liked how it could place two Presence with one option, but you could only do it if you were fine everywhere else. I also took an idea from River where it only gained Energy by using the Reclaim All option.\n\nI took the Reclaim One option from River and Thunderspeaker and put it into Shifting Desert\u2019s Presence Tracks as well. It doesn't feel as mandatory as it does when playing River, but it's still a good spike in Power.\n\nOne of the biggest things that I learned while making Desert is that Presence Tracks are a lot harder to balance and figure out than I had originally thought. Several iterations had lots of Elements in them and some of them ramped up too quickly. Now that I had a double place Presence option, the Presence Tracks needed to be weaker. I'm still messing around with the Energy gain, but it feels good at the moment. Turns out most of the power in the Spirit and how it fares in each state of the game is largely determined by how it's Presence Tracks are set up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Structural Testing (Part 6)**\n\nDoes it work? Yes, yes it does.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Coherence Testing (Part 7)**\n\nDo all the pieces contribute?\n\nI found this part of play-testing to be the hardest. I found that during several iterations of the Unique Power Cards there were too many times where I just wanted to Reclaim my hand and play the same two Powers over and over again. Other times I would never use one of the Unique Power Cards and simply save it as forget-fodder for Major Powers later. Both of these are signs that the coherence of the Spirit is off and that something needs to be changed.\n\nIn its current form, I use all of the Unique Power Cards fairly equally and I know the Coherence Testing portion of the design is a lot better than before due to a specific scenario that occurred a few times during testing. I had forgotten one of my Unique Power Cards in order to acquire a Major Power and then ON THE VERY NEXT TURN I looked in my hand and wondered where that Unique Power Card had gone because the board suddenly had a great way for it to be played. I looked for it in my hand and realized with horror that I had just forgotten it. It made me smile when I realized that each of the Unique Power Cards had their place. It wasn\u2019t just one Unique Power Card either, this has happened with three of the four.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Balance Testing (Part 8)**\n\nIs the power level appropriate?\n\nI think so. It doesn\u2019t invalidate the early game and struggles with larger clumps of Invaders in the late game. It can play for Major Powers if it has to, but it isn\u2019t a sustainable way to play the Spirit for more than a turn.\n\nHere\u2019s the best part (for me, at least), I kept track of all my revisions throughout the process and it's been amazing to watch how certain events caused a shift in ideologies and designs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow for a few miscellaneous tips and things from the designer/developers (just in case you haven\u2019t heard them before). These aren't in a coherent order, just a smattering of some thoughts that helped my process a lot:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTed:\n\n&gt;Unique Powers don't necessarily cost the same as Minor Powers (some cost 2 or 3) but they use the same costing formula. Every effect has an associated energy value, and the cost of a Minor Power reflects that value. 1 card play is also a cost, worth (IIRC) about 2 energy. So a Minor Power that costs 0 has an effect worth about 2 energy, and a Minor Power that costs 1 has an effect worth about 3 energy. Unique Powers use the same costing formula, so a unique power that costs 2 will have a 4 energy effect, etc. A Unique Power that costs 0-1 should have the same power level as a Minor Power with the same cost.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cA lot of this centers around the Element Pie (Spirit Island's take on MtG's color pie). Basically which effects belong to which elements. For example, Sun is the element of command, so many effects which move Dahan have Sun. Moon is the element of change and transformation. Earth is about consistency and repetition, so the earth spirits tend to have a relatively stronger \"reclaim all\" growth option. Air is the opposite-- air spirits have a weaker reclaim all.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And of course there's other stuff not affiliated with elements that range from good guidelines to hard rules. For example, Spirits can never destroy Dahan for a resource gain. They can only destroy Dahan as collateral damage. That's a hard rule. Cities can never be moved-- that's just a guideline, which a few major powers can break. But you need a really good reason to break it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLeif:\n\n&gt;Major Powers, on the other hand, get a discount (I don't recall how much) to account for the cost of forgetting a power. So a Major Power that costs 2 will be more powerful than a Unique Power that costs 2.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A low complexity spirit may never have elements on its presence tracks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDylan:\n\n&gt;Some tidbits to bear in mind:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\* Elements have value. To fine-tune the cost of a card, add or subtract elements.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\* Card plays have value. A 0-cost card provides benefit, because you're giving up something to play the card.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\* Targeting restrictions lower the cost of a card.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\* Unique powers need to be costed the same way as other powers, or it warps the game in undesirable way.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\* Major Powers are costed approximately as if you never hit the threshold. The extra benefit of sometimes hitting the threshold cancels the cost of having to forget a card.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEric:\n\n&gt;I have an extremely crufty spreadsheet for Power Card costing. It's very much a starting-point, **not** an end-all-and-be-all - it comes in spot-on for fairly vanilla Minor Powers, but multi-part effects can have internal synergies/anti-synergies, and uncommon effects don't necessarily have a pinned-down cost. (Or I have a cost but know it's not quite right.) Also, some modifiers (eg: Fast, Range, terrain restrictions) are really more multipliers than flat adds/subtracts - I have flat adds/subtracts that I use for low-cost Powers, but need to scale them up when dealing with higher costs.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Growth costing is more recent, and is in Ted's + my heads.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Uniques are usually costed exactly as per Minors, but:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(a) This is deceptive, because when you add/remove an element from a Unique Power Card you know \\*exactly\\* how awesome/terrible it is for the Spirit getting it based on what their innates need, whereas for a Minor Power it's just a probabilistic minor nudge to the costing;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(b) Unique Power Cards \\*can\\* vary off of normal costing if need be, but doing so by too much creates often-undesirable dynamics. If you overcost/underpower the Unique Power, it becomes Forget-fodder for a Major Power (or perhaps Choice Event). If you undercost/overpower it, it makes Reclaim effects more valuable, and can over-synergize with things that allow Repeats - e.g., if you made a Spirit that had a Unique Power that should cost 5-6 Energy but only cost 1, its game would probably focus around trying to flog that as much as possible.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Major Powers do get a small boost just for being Majors, but not nearly enough to compensate for the loss of a Power Card (a Major Power that did the exact same thing as a Minor Power would cost about 2/3 of an Energy less). The opportunity for hitting threshold effects fills in the rest of that value. Earlier iterations had actual costing formulas for threshold effects - e.g., \"A 3-3-2 threshold should have an effect that's about N% of the value of the main effect\" - but eventually I was going more on play experience than numbers and just stopped updating the model.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The concept of \"element pie\" is much looser in Spirit Island than in M:tG. The same effect might provide / require radically different elements depending on *how* it's being enacted. But there are definitely trends.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ted's list is pretty much spot-on for development, and nicely captures layers of importance / ripple-effects. It doesn't cover the way I initially come up with designs, though, which tends to be more of a ping-pong iteration between theme and mechanics, using each to brainstorm on / flesh out the other.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Whatever the guide, one step - or perhaps a follow-on to every step - is going to be \"iterate a lot\". :-)\n\nAnd with that, I bid you all adieu. It\u2019s been quite the adventure and hopefully someone was able to glean from my choices and mistakes. I love talking about the design process of creating Spirits for this wonderful game.\n\nMy TL;DR for this entire journey is summarized by the title of this final article. No matter what you do, or how much research you put into your own Spirit, you need to iterate upon the idea. Make small changes and put it through the testing cycle again. Keep doing it until you\u2019re happy where it is. It could take one iteration, it could take dozens, or even hundreds (as I\u2019m sure the official Spirits do/did).\n\nYou\u2019ve all heard enough from me these past few weeks. If you have any questions about anything in this regard, I would love to talk about them. Until next time, I\u2019ll be working on Vicious Thorns Lash Out In Anger and Swampy Swamp Swamps a Swampy Swamp (because names are hard).", "author_fullname": "t2_nqwfg", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Spirit Island Home-brew - Pt. 5 (Final) - Iterate, Iterate, Iterate", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_cakhsi", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 33, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": "2fdfa772-9cf0-11e8-922c-0e3a76b3c6b0", "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 33, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1562589729.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"a": ":spirit_island:", "e": "emoji", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/5dhccdeqncf11_t5_2qmjp/spirit_island"}, {"e": "text", "t": " Heart of the Wildfire"}], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1562618229.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "domain": "self.boardgames", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Eric: I agree to the terms for creating Spirit Island game elements&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://querki.net/u/darker/spirit-island-faq/#!.9v5ka4u\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;set forth in the FAQ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c4mxeg/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_1_intro_and_initial/\"&gt;Part 1 - Intro and Initial Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c64wqe/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_2_creating_the_thematic/\"&gt;Part 2 - Creating the Thematic Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c7s2pn/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_3_the_first_rough_draft/\"&gt;Part 3 - The First Rough Draft and Play-Test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c922pk/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_4_back_to_the_drawing/\"&gt;Part 4 - Back to the Drawing Board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward from the previous article all the way to now.

It just felt good once I made it match how Flash Flood works for River Surges. With the mention of a theme change (Damage to Destroy) it didn&amp;#39;t take much to modify this Power. It allows for some good choices, it&amp;#39;s an effective Power assuming you don&amp;#39;t use it terribly and destroy lots of Dahan with it. Really liking how this one feels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revitalizing Oasis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted a way for Desert to deal with adding the Blight that it did, so this was the solution. It has a use outside of clearing out Blight and it feels good to use. I like the conditional having two Dahan so that the Blight removal isn&amp;#39;t free. For now it&amp;#39;s in a good place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bury In Tombs Of Sand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This Power allows for some flexibility when wanting to Destroy just one Town or being and to deal with them just outside of your range.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blinding Sandstorms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A defensive Power. There&amp;#39;s not too much going on here. It incentivizes placing lots of Presence in the same location. I like how it feels, I&amp;#39;ll probably need to tweak the numbers a little more since it feels like it Defends just a bit too much sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growth Options (Part 5)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things changed a bit here. I went looking at River Surges and Thunderspeaker for guidance, since they seemed (to me) to be Spirits of the Sun as well. After taking a break from Shifting Desert and playing a few games of River, I learned that I really liked how it could place two Presence with one option, but you could only do it if you were fine everywhere else. I also took an idea from River where it only gained Energy by using the Reclaim All option.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took the Reclaim One option from River and Thunderspeaker and put it into Shifting Desert\u2019s Presence Tracks as well. It doesn&amp;#39;t feel as mandatory as it does when playing River, but it&amp;#39;s still a good spike in Power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest things that I learned while making Desert is that Presence Tracks are a lot harder to balance and figure out than I had originally thought. Several iterations had lots of Elements in them and some of them ramped up too quickly. Now that I had a double place Presence option, the Presence Tracks needed to be weaker. I&amp;#39;m still messing around with the Energy gain, but it feels good at the moment. Turns out most of the power in the Spirit and how it fares in each state of the game is largely determined by how it&amp;#39;s Presence Tracks are set up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural Testing (Part 6)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does it work? Yes, yes it does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coherence Testing (Part 7)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do all the pieces contribute?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found this part of play-testing to be the hardest. I found that during several iterations of the Unique Power Cards there were too many times where I just wanted to Reclaim my hand and play the same two Powers over and over again. Other times I would never use one of the Unique Power Cards and simply save it as forget-fodder for Major Powers later. Both of these are signs that the coherence of the Spirit is off and that something needs to be changed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In its current form, I use all of the Unique Power Cards fairly equally and I know the Coherence Testing portion of the design is a lot better than before due to a specific scenario that occurred a few times during testing. I had forgotten one of my Unique Power Cards in order to acquire a Major Power and then ON THE VERY NEXT TURN I looked in my hand and wondered where that Unique Power Card had gone because the board suddenly had a great way for it to be played. I looked for it in my hand and realized with horror that I had just forgotten it. It made me smile when I realized that each of the Unique Power Cards had their place. It wasn\u2019t just one Unique Power Card either, this has happened with three of the four.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balance Testing (Part 8)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is the power level appropriate?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think so. It doesn\u2019t invalidate the early game and struggles with larger clumps of Invaders in the late game. It can play for Major Powers if it has to, but it isn\u2019t a sustainable way to play the Spirit for more than a turn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s the best part (for me, at least), I kept track of all my revisions throughout the process and it&amp;#39;s been amazing to watch how certain events caused a shift in ideologies and designs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now for a few miscellaneous tips and things from the designer/developers (just in case you haven\u2019t heard them before). These aren&amp;#39;t in a coherent order, just a smattering of some thoughts that helped my process a lot:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ted:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unique Powers don&amp;#39;t necessarily cost the same as Minor Powers (some cost 2 or 3) but they use the same costing formula. Every effect has an associated energy value, and the cost of a Minor Power reflects that value. 1 card play is also a cost, worth (IIRC) about 2 energy. So a Minor Power that costs 0 has an effect worth about 2 energy, and a Minor Power that costs 1 has an effect worth about 3 energy. Unique Powers use the same costing formula, so a unique power that costs 2 will have a 4 energy effect, etc. A Unique Power that costs 0-1 should have the same power level as a Minor Power with the same cost.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cA lot of this centers around the Element Pie (Spirit Island&amp;#39;s take on MtG&amp;#39;s color pie). Basically which effects belong to which elements. For example, Sun is the element of command, so many effects which move Dahan have Sun. Moon is the element of change and transformation. Earth is about consistency and repetition, so the earth spirits tend to have a relatively stronger &amp;quot;reclaim all&amp;quot; growth option. Air is the opposite-- air spirits have a weaker reclaim all.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And of course there&amp;#39;s other stuff not affiliated with elements that range from good guidelines to hard rules. For example, Spirits can never destroy Dahan for a resource gain. They can only destroy Dahan as collateral damage. That&amp;#39;s a hard rule. Cities can never be moved-- that&amp;#39;s just a guideline, which a few major powers can break. But you need a really good reason to break it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leif:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Major Powers, on the other hand, get a discount (I don&amp;#39;t recall how much) to account for the cost of forgetting a power. So a Major Power that costs 2 will be more powerful than a Unique Power that costs 2.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A low complexity spirit may never have elements on its presence tracks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dylan:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some tidbits to bear in mind:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;* Elements have value. To fine-tune the cost of a card, add or subtract elements.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;* Card plays have value. A 0-cost card provides benefit, because you&amp;#39;re giving up something to play the card.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;* Targeting restrictions lower the cost of a card.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;* Unique powers need to be costed the same way as other powers, or it warps the game in undesirable way.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;* Major Powers are costed approximately as if you never hit the threshold. The extra benefit of sometimes hitting the threshold cancels the cost of having to forget a card.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eric:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have an extremely crufty spreadsheet for Power Card costing. It&amp;#39;s very much a starting-point, &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; an end-all-and-be-all - it comes in spot-on for fairly vanilla Minor Powers, but multi-part effects can have internal synergies/anti-synergies, and uncommon effects don&amp;#39;t necessarily have a pinned-down cost. (Or I have a cost but know it&amp;#39;s not quite right.) Also, some modifiers (eg: Fast, Range, terrain restrictions) are really more multipliers than flat adds/subtracts - I have flat adds/subtracts that I use for low-cost Powers, but need to scale them up when dealing with higher costs.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Growth costing is more recent, and is in Ted&amp;#39;s + my heads.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uniques are usually costed exactly as per Minors, but:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(a) This is deceptive, because when you add/remove an element from a Unique Power Card you know *exactly* how awesome/terrible it is for the Spirit getting it based on what their innates need, whereas for a Minor Power it&amp;#39;s just a probabilistic minor nudge to the costing;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(b) Unique Power Cards *can* vary off of normal costing if need be, but doing so by too much creates often-undesirable dynamics. If you overcost/underpower the Unique Power, it becomes Forget-fodder for a Major Power (or perhaps Choice Event). If you undercost/overpower it, it makes Reclaim effects more valuable, and can over-synergize with things that allow Repeats - e.g., if you made a Spirit that had a Unique Power that should cost 5-6 Energy but only cost 1, its game would probably focus around trying to flog that as much as possible.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Major Powers do get a small boost just for being Majors, but not nearly enough to compensate for the loss of a Power Card (a Major Power that did the exact same thing as a Minor Power would cost about 2/3 of an Energy less). The opportunity for hitting threshold effects fills in the rest of that value. Earlier iterations had actual costing formulas for threshold effects - e.g., &amp;quot;A 3-3-2 threshold should have an effect that&amp;#39;s about N% of the value of the main effect&amp;quot; - but eventually I was going more on play experience than numbers and just stopped updating the model.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The concept of &amp;quot;element pie&amp;quot; is much looser in Spirit Island than in M:tG. The same effect might provide / require radically different elements depending on &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; it&amp;#39;s being enacted. But there are definitely trends.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ted&amp;#39;s list is pretty much spot-on for development, and nicely captures layers of importance / ripple-effects. It doesn&amp;#39;t cover the way I initially come up with designs, though, which tends to be more of a ping-pong iteration between theme and mechanics, using each to brainstorm on / flesh out the other.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever the guide, one step - or perhaps a follow-on to every step - is going to be &amp;quot;iterate a lot&amp;quot;. :-)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And with that, I bid you all adieu. It\u2019s been quite the adventure and hopefully someone was able to glean from my choices and mistakes. I love talking about the design process of creating Spirits for this wonderful game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My TL;DR for this entire journey is summarized by the title of this final article. No matter what you do, or how much research you put into your own Spirit, you need to iterate upon the idea. Make small changes and put it through the testing cycle again. Keep doing it until you\u2019re happy where it is. It could take one iteration, it could take dozens, or even hundreds (as I\u2019m sure the official Spirits do/did).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ve all heard enough from me these past few weeks. If you have any questions about anything in this regard, I would love to talk about them. Until next time, I\u2019ll be working on Vicious Thorns Lash Out In Anger and Swampy Swamp Swamps a Swampy Swamp (because names are hard).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/062oWDmN7arCWMHmpsCCVZuTuYWV9HOkUsA9wxq2a-s.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=5c8f7fc539742080bc9c6ad7a18494961577bf8f", "width": 866, "height": 582}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/062oWDmN7arCWMHmpsCCVZuTuYWV9HOkUsA9wxq2a-s.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b4249d3f49d1bcbad24a35daa6fef5e40b132ae", "width": 108, "height": 72}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/062oWDmN7arCWMHmpsCCVZuTuYWV9HOkUsA9wxq2a-s.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff511f00b4ef57400dfa43a53babd6c0bb43c0ae", "width": 216, "height": 145}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/062oWDmN7arCWMHmpsCCVZuTuYWV9HOkUsA9wxq2a-s.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79ae3ea98c6a3070d09619e8bbea6b20bfcf7616", "width": 320, "height": 215}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/062oWDmN7arCWMHmpsCCVZuTuYWV9HOkUsA9wxq2a-s.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=837321912469c60e69d73b49c9dd76cac6269a58", "width": 640, "height": 430}], "variants": {}, "id": "5Dp4AIw_iU9LO_MiIaKLF03R2sCLGcKlSgAf-vlL3SE"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": ":spirit_island: Heart of the Wildfire", "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "cakhsi", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LordMotas", "num_crossposts": 1, "num_comments": 12, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/boardgames/comments/cakhsi/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_5_final_iterate_iterate/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/cakhsi/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_5_final_iterate_iterate/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2047801, "created_utc": 1562589429.0, "discussion_type": null, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "boardgames", "selftext": "", "author_fullname": "t2_129c88", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How To Play - Bananagrams (The Dragon's Tomb)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Humor"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "humor", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_calpy6", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tXZ5lWANbR0?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

My facourite game is Spirit Island which is long and hefty but the game is dynamic and uses the time to craft an experience that I can\u2019t imagine in a shorter timeframe. A game like teotihuacan, a well crafted game with mid to high mid euro level depth and looks good, takes 2 and a half to 3 hours for an experience that to me feels like it should take an hour and a half.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please don\u2019t tell me that I should just play shorter games.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "cawjev", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "char2074DCB", "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 76, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/boardgames/comments/cawjev/discussion_board_games_on_the_whole_are_designed/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/cawjev/discussion_board_games_on_the_whole_are_designed/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2047801, "created_utc": 1562650189.0, "discussion_type": null, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "boardgames", "selftext": "I love a good game of **Innovation** or **Dominant Species**, but both games seem far more tactical than they are strategic. \n\n\nMy wife gets frustrated by the lack of viable long-term planning in these games and often tells me she doesn\u2019t understand the appeal. \n\n\nI\u2019m curious what do you think the appeal of these games is, especially considering we\u2019re in a world of gaming that very often is about long term planning.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not saying these games are devoid of strategy, but I still think they are more tactical than they are strategic.", "author_fullname": "t2_5q5gh", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Appeal of Tactical Games?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_cajyse", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": "ef809fb6-18ab-11e7-9e69-0e5a4f06ecbe", "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1562586871.0, "author_flair_css_class": "custom", "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Gaia Project"}], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1562614888.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "domain": "self.boardgames", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love a good game of &lt;strong&gt;Innovation&lt;/strong&gt;
