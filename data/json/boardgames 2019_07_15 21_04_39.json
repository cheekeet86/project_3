Sound good?\"\n\nMartial arts tends to attract introverts, often the nerdy variety (such as myself), so most of them were excited, others went along because kids just do that, and the rest did because everyone else was. There were 15 kids in camp that day, aged 6-12. With an odd number and the oldest kid looking skeptical, I made an on-the-fly modification to what I'd jotted down for the rules: one team would have a king who had no power, but would be the big-picture person who could walk around and suggest where the other kids should be going and aiming for.\n\nI asked for volunteers and got three (the three I expected would). I put the oldest (previously skeptical) one as the sole king on one side, the two younger ones as \"dual kings\" on the other. Boy did leadership have a huge effect!\n\n[Early in the game](https://imgur.com/S8vsKNx)\n\nI won't dive into the full nitty-gritty of the game, but there were red and white teams, each with wiffle golf balls for armies (we normally use them for bullets and the like in other games). Each general got a d6, 3 armies, to start and could move 1 mat \"square\" per turn, optionally leaving an army behind to control it. Moving through a square already controlled gave an extra movement.\n\nObjectives were forts, villages, a port, monsters to fight for unknown rewards, and the other team. At castles, forts, and villages, players could attempt to recruit more armies instead. One of my assistant instructors roamed handling the dice rolls for white team, while I did the same for red and handled any combats.\n\nWhile some kids focused on expanding territory, the focus of both teams was to take the ports and when the first was conquered, I told them about ships and the far island with a giant guarding a powerful artifact. Both teams built their first, turned a general into an admiral, and sent them off towards the island. After a sea battle, red's admiral had to retreat onto a reef (a sai laid in an ocean \"square\") and lost everything, giving white dominance of the deep sea and the island. This turn eventually led to red's victory.\n\n[The serpent driven to white's capitol. Admirals in the far distance heading for the island](https://imgur.com/yJGI22W)\n\nWith the island in white hands, red's (brilliant) king decided they needed to decisively crush the poorly-defended white capitol before white beat the giant and got the artifact with whatever power it gave. He organized and orchestrated a perfectly timed meeting of three generals adjacent to the white capitol at the same time two ships from the other side of the game world landed on a beachhead at the capitol's rear.\n\nThe white kings were both hanging out at the island, excited about the giant and didn't notice the approach and buildup until their capitol was under attack from 5 generals and \\~25 armies against their defense of a castle, 2 generals, and &lt;10 armies.\n\nWhite rushed all their mainland generals to help and had some lucky rolls that let them hold out longer than expected against the red juggernaut, but were on the brink of losing when the two admirals across the game world took out the giant and claimed its artifact, giving them extra dice in combat and also allowing them to fly!\n\n[Fighting the giant](https://imgur.com/obaf0gP)\n\nThey could have swooped in and conquered the completely undefended red capitol, but instead dropped their troops at their capitol, taking the numeric odds from 5:1 to 3:1 against them. Even with the power of the artifact, the odds were too great and they were buried under the red juggernaut.\n\nThe game ended up lasting \\~2 hours with even the 6 year-olds locked-in the whole time. The only one who got bored was the red king who, after seeing his final plan was in motion, headed off to beat up a Wavemaster for the last half-hour, returning only briefly when white's admirals flew in. He prudently directed a general to protect their capitol against white realizing they could fly there, then returned to his attack on the Wavemaster.\n\nOverall, the game was a great hit!

Boardgames, party games, anything that people can sit in a group and enjoy.\n\nSome of the friends in my group is unhappy with me for inviting them for a \"games night.\" We usually play Catan, Game of Thrones second edition, Dead of Winter or Hogwarts Battle between the 3 to 5 of us. (3 girls and 2 guys)\n\nTwo of the girls are now complaining about \"game nights.\" Beforehand we will decide what we are playing and normally play 1 round (sometimes 2,) as most of these games take some time. They say that we don't have game nights as we only play one game per night. They want to play party games like Cards against Humanity, Secret Hitler, What do you meme and uno or other card games. Even though  these games are quicker to play, they are more fun in bigger groups.\n\nAll the games exept GOT is mine and the nights are always at my house. Have you ever experienced something similar? How can I change their views (if even possible) to just see that if they are invited to play boardgames during the week, it is specifically for us in a smaller group and the party games is for the extended group of friends over weekends at braais/BBQ's/get togethers?", "author_fullname": "t2_3d0wy8h8", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Am I wrong/selling the night wrong?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_c6abqt", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Question", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1561694884.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 6, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.boardgames", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have loved boardgames from a very young age.

It was a fun time, but we noticed a bit of a imbalance. Noting that it was our first playthrough we realize that there were things that the alien could and needs to do on the first turn. Such as locking down the Rover ASAP, but hindsight is always 20/20. \n\nBut here comes the title of the post, we noticed that since we played with fewer players, 3 hunted vs the alien. That the chance of the hunted escapes each round gets radically higher. Since the alien starts with two tokens only, if the hunted played well to diversify their selections and saved their survival cards the alien can be evaded consistently. \n\nHave you guys encountered this scenario with the alien having a tougher time vs a smaller team of hunted? What house rules would you suggest to even out the imbalance.

This is prominent in the Oak, Cherry Blossom and Jacaranda but I think it&amp;#39;s on the others as well just not as noticeable. Does anyone else have this issue or is it a counterfeit or fluke? I got it at my FLGS and it even had a &amp;quot;transparency&amp;quot; QR code on the plastic wrap I threw away that was supposed to validate it&amp;#39;s authenticity but I didn&amp;#39;t think to keep it.

At the end of the round, more cards are added to the draw deck. The game ends only if the players can deplete the draw deck as well as their hands without letting time run out.\n\nIf one threat shows up too many times, the team fails the mission. The team must play their threats correctly in order to gain any progress.
