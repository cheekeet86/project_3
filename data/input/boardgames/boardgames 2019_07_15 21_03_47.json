"data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "boardgames", "selftext": "  \n\nAfter 2 years of working on my board game \"Werewolf vs. Vampire\", I would like to offer to write a developer diary for the game.\n\nIt's about all the small steps after the offer - to the finished product including shipping.\n\nMy question is, are you interested?\n\nLeave me a comment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started to keep the diary on Facebook and so I already listed the first 5 days here. If you like this, I would post more diary entries here once a week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs previous knowledge is still important that I had a campaign on Kickstarter, which I had to stop. Why, you can read here:\n\n## Day 1\n\nFinally I agreed with a developing company  on the production settings. They are going to send me templates for the different items.\n\n## Day 2\n\nI have received the following question:  \n Why did you cancel the last Kickstarter campaign?\n\n**The short answer**  \n 3D Minis\n\n**Detail answer**  \n In the first campaign, a lot of people asked about my minis. So, in order to do everything right in the second campaign, I offered minis.  \n I had to stop the last Kickstarter campaign because only 3 people wanted them.   \n Therefore, I was in a dilemma.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I get 2 Minis produced, there is a one-time amount of about 2,300 euros.   \n Even if everyone buys miniatures this costs about 10 Euro on Kickstarter (5\u20ac + Kickstarter costs + financial institution + returns).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut for 10 Euro apparently only 3 people were willed to buy these. So I would not only have to cover for the costs for 300 games, but also the costs for 497 minis.\n\n## Day 3\n\nI told you that on Kickstarter not all supporters wanted miniatures for 10 Euro.\n\nAt the same time, it was not possible for me to keep this offer for 3 bidders.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut now to the solution for the miniatures problem.\n\nSince the campaign a lot of time has gone by and I have been looking a lot for 3D miniatures solutions. For a long time, I didn't find anything that met my quality standards.\n\nA few approaches:\n\n\\- Smallest production quantity: the price per miniature is then 7.50\u20ac So even more money and even fewer supporters who want to have the product then.\n\n\\- DIY 3D printing (filament): Absolutely not. Apart from the fact that the people, who try to get good results of 3D printing spend a LITTLE more time on this task - the result is not sufficient for me. Of course, you can get better results, but only by using sandpaper and a LOT of time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen by chance I became aware of another printing process.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom time to time I enter search terms at different platforms and on a wonderful Wednesday evening this was '3D printing' on Kickstarter. The result was a printing process that I hadn't really followed until then, as the printers were at 2,300 Euros.\n\nNow the price was below 300 Euros. So I sent a mail to the 3D nerd I trust and asked if that could be good and promptly received the answer \"No, they start at over 2k Euros\".\n\nAfter I had sent the link, the statement changed into: \"Wow, that sounds pretty good.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I supported the printer. But everyone who is involved with Kickstarter also knows that many projects in the field of technology failed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I wanted to know more about it and have really been involved with the printing process in detail. And look at that, on Amazon there was an almost equivalent printer with a 20 Euro discount and one material for free. Another 2 days later I ordered the printer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat should I say:\n\n\\- Easy to use\n\n\\- Real fun\n\n\\- Super results (professional)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then took the first results with me to my 3D friend and because of the miniatures I printed out with them, another printer was sold immediately.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe printouts so far look so good that I am convinced that I can produce small quantities at at least the same price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat way I won't run into the same trap again for the next campaign and can even offer a little highlight. But that won't be revealed yet.\n\n## Day 4\n\nToday I would like to say something about the decision on the production quantity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA large part of the decision was taken from me:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen you produce a game, there's always a minimum quantity that you have to buy.\n\nFor most of the manufacturers I wrote to, this is 500. Others want to sell at least 1500 pieces.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've read in many forums that at the end of a Kickstarter campaign you can sell the same amount through other distribution channels. That should then include Amazon, Ebay, dealers, game events and this should also be the end of sales.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my first campaign, I had oriented myself to other titles and wanted to recoup production costs as much as possible. Therefore, I had specified 8,000\u20ac as target mark. That would have been about 365 supporters. But I landed at 80 (some jumped off towards the end).\n\nWith the improved second campaign I had to break off with almost 60 supporters. I think I could have got 120 supporters here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, let's stay with 120 supporters.

If you like this, I would post more diary entries here once a week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As previous knowledge is still important that I had a campaign on Kickstarter, which I had to stop. Why, you can read here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally I agreed with a developing company  on the production settings. They are going to send me templates for the different items.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have received the following question:&lt;br/&gt;\n Why did you cancel the last Kickstarter campaign?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The short answer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n 3D Minis&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detail answer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n In the first campaign, a lot of people asked about my minis. So, in order to do everything right in the second campaign, I offered minis.&lt;br/&gt;\n I had to stop the last Kickstarter campaign because only 3 people wanted them.&lt;br/&gt;\n Therefore, I was in a dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I get 2 Minis produced, there is a one-time amount of about 2,300 euros.&lt;br/&gt;\n Even if everyone buys miniatures this costs about 10 Euro on Kickstarter (5\u20ac + Kickstarter costs + financial institution + returns).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But for 10 Euro apparently only 3 people were willed to buy these. So I would not only have to cover for the costs for 300 games, but also the costs for 497 minis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Day 3&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told you that on Kickstarter not all supporters wanted miniatures for 10 Euro.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the same time, it was not possible for me to keep this offer for 3 bidders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But now to the solution for the miniatures problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since the campaign a lot of time has gone by and I have been looking a lot for 3D miniatures solutions. For a long time, I didn&amp;#39;t find anything that met my quality standards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few approaches:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Smallest production quantity: the price per miniature is then 7.50\u20ac So even more money and even fewer supporters who want to have the product then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- DIY 3D printing (filament): Absolutely not. Apart from the fact that the people, who try to get good results of 3D printing spend a LITTLE more time on this task - the result is not sufficient for me. Of course, you can get better results, but only by using sandpaper and a LOT of time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then by chance I became aware of another printing process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From time to time I enter search terms at different platforms and on a wonderful Wednesday evening this was &amp;#39;3D printing&amp;#39; on Kickstarter. The result was a printing process that I hadn&amp;#39;t really followed until then, as the printers were at 2,300 Euros.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now the price was below 300 Euros. So I sent a mail to the 3D nerd I trust and asked if that could be good and promptly received the answer &amp;quot;No, they start at over 2k Euros&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I had sent the link, the statement changed into: &amp;quot;Wow, that sounds pretty good.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I supported the printer. But everyone who is involved with Kickstarter also knows that many projects in the field of technology failed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I wanted to know more about it and have really been involved with the printing process in detail. And look at that, on Amazon there was an almost equivalent printer with a 20 Euro discount and one material for free. Another 2 days later I ordered the printer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What should I say:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Easy to use&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Real fun&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Super results (professional)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then took the first results with me to my 3D friend and because of the miniatures I printed out with them, another printer was sold immediately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The printouts so far look so good that I am convinced that I can produce small quantities at at least the same price.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That way I won&amp;#39;t run into the same trap again for the next campaign and can even offer a little highlight. But that won&amp;#39;t be revealed yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Day 4&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to say something about the decision on the production quantity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A large part of the decision was taken from me:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you produce a game, there&amp;#39;s always a minimum quantity that you have to buy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For most of the manufacturers I wrote to, this is 500. Others want to sell at least 1500 pieces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve read in many forums that at the end of a Kickstarter campaign you can sell the same amount through other distribution channels. That should then include Amazon, Ebay, dealers, game events and this should also be the end of sales.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my first campaign, I had oriented myself to other titles and wanted to recoup production costs as much as possible. Therefore, I had specified 8,000\u20ac as target mark. That would have been about 365 supporters. But I landed at 80 (some jumped off towards the end).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the improved second campaign I had to break off with almost 60 supporters. I think I could have got 120 supporters here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;#39;s stay with 120 supporters. If I could sell that much again in post-sale, I should make 240 pieces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The temptation to produce more is huge, because the different production quantities don&amp;#39;t cost so much at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I compared the offers, the following came out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;500 pieces \u00e1 15\u20ac - 7.500\u20ac&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.500 pcs \u00e1 7\u20ac - 10.500\u20ac each&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But since I would already have 260 games on stock at the moment, I don&amp;#39;t have to spend 3.000\u20ac to fill the stock completely with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I even found a company that would have produced 260 games for me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now guess what it would have cost: right - 7.500 Euro.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Day 5&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to talk about the different offers I got for 10-sided dice.

They are always entertaining and often include fascinating segments in their reviews, like that time they discussed orientalism and the place of women (that is, none) in Istanbul. Their recent podcast featuring the book \"Top 10 Games You Can Play In Your Head, By Yourself\" was the best and most original gaming content I've heard in a long while. Even my reddit name is an homage to one of their reviews. That said, something about them has been nagging me for some time and I just had to voice it out. It probably bugs me more because I like them so much.\n\nThey so often get the rules of their games wrong.\n\nIt occurs so often that I can't help but notice it. It happened for Gugong recently: they said game was good but a bit underwhelming, and a commenter on their site wrote \"You were using the double servant wrong\", to which Quinns replied \" I checked the rules on this *three time*s and still apparently got it wrong?\". Of course it makes you wonder: would they have liked the game better if they played it right? Probably. Maybe? And now almost 100k viewers saw the \"underwhelmed\" video review, and in the currently saturated games market, this means most of those people are probably going to pass on the game.\n\nIt happened with their playthrough of Gloomhaven. A Youtube commenter wrote a list of 10 (!) rules errors they made in the video. But didn't Matt spend hours and hours creating a wonderfully produced 35 minutes review of the game about a year before? Did he do all the playtesting, script writing, video shooting and editing, the review was seen by 675k people... and he had the rules wrong all along? Did he just forget them?\n\nThis happens with very simple games too. Have a look at their Gin Rummy video, even then Quinns makes lots of rules mistakes. Which are corrected in text overlays, but then they appear so often that it becomes hard to follow. And as an internet jerk who comfortably enjoys your free content and hard labour, let me ask a very naive question: for a video where the whole point is to teach the game, for a simple game that you just taught in 5 minutes not counting a bit of banter... why not just reshoot the whole thing on the spot and make it right? What's the point of a rules video where the rules are wrong?\n\nIt happened again with the very simple press-your-luck game \"That\u2019s Not Lemonade\" (18 cards and a few cups) they described as being not very good in their podcast. In the next one they noted the designer had contacted them saying that they had missed a central rule of the game, which made it way less dumb than they had presented it. How could they still get such a simple game wrong, especially when they feature it on their podcast? And then I remembered them saying how they played Skull wrong for a long time at first, with people bidding free-for-all instead of in order. Which luckily for this other games publisher made the game more fun for them this time. But when you cannot grasp the rules of a game like Skull, of course you're going to make mistakes with Gugong and Gloomhaven.\n\nGranted, most of these games, they acknowledged the errors on their website or in a follow-up podcast. And of course it is hard to get rules right when you have to try so many in a week. Errors happen of course, it's fine. But then in this case it looks like it's becoming systematic. I can't help but get annoyed, because those recurring mistakes make me doubt the value of all their other very entertaining reviews. Especially for games with complex rules like Lisboa and Root, and for games they say they did not enjoy. The writing is top-notch, the video production stellar... but if I can't trust the review is it worth it?\n\nMany of my friends who play occasionaly don't care much about rules. When they open their brand new game, they skim the rules to get to play as fast as possible. And who cares, right? Isn't the goal to have fun? They are surprised when they play the same game with me and the rules are way different than they remember. SUSD has also been focused from the start on having fun with your friends, and that is for the best. But as game reviewers with hundreds of thousands of viewers, shouldn't they be held to a higher standard?
