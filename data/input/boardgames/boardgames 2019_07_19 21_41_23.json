Once we were introduced to Pandemic, co-op games have been our bread and butter. We'll mix in the occasional game of Terraforming Mars or Concordia, but co-op games seem to be the ideal game for many couples - and we fit that mold. We've had a lot of enjoyment lately playing co-op deck builders in particular, so I thought I'd share what we've learned so far. I'll talk about these games roughly from least to most favorite. There are a couple of games in this list that might not fit the definition exactly, but this is my post, so I'll do what I want.\n\nFirst up is **Shadowrun: Crossfire** (10 plays). This game has the structure of a great deck builder, but fails in the execution. I really liked the theme - the mix of futuristic tech and magic was very cool (I understand there is a Shadowrun universe, but I know nothing about it). The game had some neat little elements - a campaign like structure where you can earn perks to make your character stronger, which allows you to attempt harder missions.\n\nIt's failings were critical for us, however. Lots of co-op games are swingy because of card draw, but S:C pretty much takes the cake. You can have insta-lose right away due to bad card draw, or you can feel good about yourself and then get massacred in one turn. I like my co-ops hard, but reasonably so - I don't want to have to grind out the same mission over and over to gain perks. It's a board game, not a video game.\n\n*You might like this if*: you like losing a lot, you love the Shadowrun universe, insta-lose is your friend.\n\n**Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle** (20 plays) is an interesting one. This game is the best bad game I've every played. As a family of Harry Potter fanatics, buying this game was a no-brainer, but my expectations were low. Once we got into it, we found numerous things that we loved, and just as many that we hated. Essentially, it is a great game that is fundamentally broken. You can read [my specific thoughts here](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8bqqyz/harry_potter_hogwarts_battle_is_the_best_bad_game/), but to sum up: 1. Poor player count scaling, 2. No categories/tiers of villains or cards, 3. The Spiral of Death.\n\nBut on the plus side, it's got some really good mechanics that incorporate everything you love from the Harry Potter universe. (If you're interested, here's a link to my [post about house rules for the game](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8bziei/harry_potter_hogwarts_battle_house_rules/).)\n\n*You might like this if*: you love Harry Potter.\n\n**Shadowrift** (5 plays), is my newest find in the co-op deck builder category. You should take my comments with a grain of salt because A) I've only played 5 times, and B) There is a revised 2nd Edition I've never seen (I acquired a 1st edition copy). In this game you are heroes defending a town from invading monsters, who apparently are coming in through a rift. You can win by either building walls around the town, or sealing the rifts. There are a couple of clever mechanics in this game, notably the Town and Traveler cards. Instead of just having a town with health points, you are actually constructing a deck of townspeople by hiring villagers to join the town. On your turn, you can use the abilities of the townsfolk to assist you in your fight. However, when the monsters kill someone in the town, they are replaced by Corpses, which (as you may guess) aren't great.\n\nIt's a neat take on the genre, and I like the decision space it provides for you. There is a variable market of cards to buy from, and the base game comes with 5 (6?) enemies to fight. Overall, it's an entertaining game with more good than bad.\n\nThe biggest issue I've had with the game is that you mix one Shadowrift per player into the monster deck of 20 cards. When those pop up makes a huge difference in winning. Too early and the game is a cake walk, too late and you might not survive. But compared to some of the other games, that issue isn't a game breaker.\n\nI would absolutely recommend trying to grab a copy in a trade on the cheap (heck, there's even a [copy available for $1 plus shipping](https://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/product/1880465) right now). I understand that there's a 2nd Edition with expansions and more content, but the price tag seems high to me. I'm expecting to get 20+ plays out of it and then move it in a trade. I don't see it as a long term game without more content.\n\n*You might like this if*: you want to play around with an interesting shared deck mechanic, you like trying out fun new games that won't take over your life\n\nWell, speaking of taking over your life, let's talk about **Legendary: Marvel** (10 plays). I'm just going to lump all the flavors of Legendary together and call them Legendary: Marvel. There is a huge amount of content in the Legendary game universe, so you can explore it as deeply as you wish. Essentially every game you have a starting hand, there is a random market of cards, there are villains, and there's a big bad to fight. Every fight is slightly different due to the various mechanics brought to the table by your setup. Every game I've played of this has been enjoyable but not spectacular. In general it's a well tuned system that feels just a bit too sterile to me.\n\nMy friend owns lots of content for this game, and we always joke that playing Legendary is 3 games in 1. Game 1: Assemble the cards, Game 2: Play the game, Game 3: Sort all the cards and put everything away again.\n\n*You might like this if*: you love the IP, you have an organization fetish\n\nNow, before you yell at me that **Sentinels of the Multiverse** (12 plays) isn't a deck builder, let me just say this: You're correct. However, it feels so much like these other games that I feel it is legal to include this in the list. If you are looking for a co-op deck builder to play, SotM might be the game you love. Sentinels has a few amazing things going for it, and one big downside. The positives first: Awesome theme - just a wonderful comic book world that you get to play in. Great decks - instead of building a deck as you go, each hero has their own pre-constructed deck. And boy does each deck play differently. You get a real sense of how each hero is a different character by what they can do with their cards. Super quick to set up - grab hero decks, bad guy deck, environment deck, and your tokens. Bam! Ready to play.\n\nDid I say \"tokens\"? Ah, yes, to the negative - saying that Sentinels is a bit fiddly is like saying Campaign for North Africa runs a bit long. I'm getting ready to attack and I have a +1 Damage token on my guy, and there's another +1 Damage token ... is that for me, or only when attacking the Environment? Wait, why is that +1 Damage Taken token there? Did the card that brought that into play get discarded or not? What type of damage did he do? Am I immune to fire or not?\n\nIt's not insurmountable, and it definitely gets easier with multiple plays, but managing the tokens and health is a barrier to enjoying the game. If that sounds frustrating, don't even try this game. But if you can get over that hurdle, Sentinels offers some truly great experiences with very fun, thematic cards.\n\n*You might like this if*: you like superheroes, cool combos, and are fine with fiddly mechanics\n\nSo, you thought I was cheating with Sentinels? How about this - my next game is **Orleans: Invasion** (20 plays), a game that doesn't even have cards! Before you string me up by my meeples, hear me out: Orleans is a bag builder, and a bag builder is simply a modified deck builder. I'm including it because I find this game definitely scratches some of the same itches of the other games on this list. You're working together, building up an engine, trying to beat the Big Bad.\n\nIn order to play the cooperative version of Orleans, you need the base game plus The Invasion expansion. On the one hand, that's a relatively big investment; on the other hand, you also have the exceptional base game of Orleans to play. The Invasion expansion does a masterful job of turning a purely competitive game into a cooperative experience. Each player gets their own role which requires them to achieve different goals along with the group goals. The roles change every game, and the random events change, so the puzzle is different every time. Difficulty can easily be scaled up or down. We have had numerous games that came down to the last turn, which is exactly what I want in a co-op.\n\n*You might like this if*: you like bag building, you like Orleans\n\nI'm saving the best for last, so it's time for **Aeon's End** (150+ plays). I won't deny that I'm a fanboy. Aeon's End has marched all the way up to be my #1 favorite game of all time. I own all content, and backed the latest Kickstarter. So at least you know where I'm coming from here.\n\nIn Aeon's End, you play mages who are trying to defend Gravehold from an attacking Nemesis. The primary strength of AE is the incredible variability you get with the different types of Mages, Nemeses, and market cards. Every game feels unique and different - a mage that might work well against one Nemesis could fall flat against a different one. My wife and I like to do a completely randomized setup, and then tweak it if we end up in a battle we can't win.\n\nMechanically, Aeon's End is a finely tuned machine. The vast majority of the games we've played have been entertaining and close. You feel like you're getting stronger, which is good because you know the minions get stronger as well. The Nemesis deck is built in tiers. Each Nemesis has their own unique cards, and those are mixed in with a random collection of basic cards. These are stacked with the easiest tier on top. The criticism could be: \"It takes longer to set up.\" However, I will take a slightly longer setup time that gives me a better overall experience instead of the insta-lose games you can have with HP:HB or Shadowrun. And you are rarely put in a no-win situation. Even games where we lose in the mid-game are winnable with a strategy change. Most of the time we just reset the game and give it another go.\n\nAnd, Aeon's End is simply cool. You have to open breaches to create more space to play more spells. You choose between gems, relics, and spells to buy to get the perfect deck. You can also charge up the special ability that only your mage has. The pace, flow, and feel of the game just sing for me. (Important note: I vastly prefer AE at 2P over 3 or 4. I just feel you get more powerful and can do more cool things at the lower player count.)\n\nFinally, there are two important mechanics to mention. 1. A deck builder with no shuffling. It's a cool thing, because this game expects you to pack your discard pile to get powerful combos. It adds interesting decisions on when to buy a card, or when to hold cards in your hand for the next turn. 2. Variable turn order. At 2P, everybody (each mage and the Nemesis) get 2 turn order cards. Those 6 cards are shuffled and flipped to determine who goes when. It makes a procedural game more dynamic. This brings up another common complaint of AE: \"You can win or lose depending on how the turn order deck was shuffled!\" Often times that's true, but I love it - and if you end up losing, there was probably something better you could have done earlier to put yourself in a better position.\n\nSo there we go. Way too much text about co-op deckbuilders. I'd love to hear if anybody has other games they've played and would recommend. I've got a couple on my Want in Trade list, so hopefully they'll make it to my table at some point.", "author_fullname": "t2_cb5nt", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Cooperative Deck Builders - The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_cb2s9i", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 689, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": "c63d6e78-18aa-11e7-9922-0ef608c792b0", "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 689, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "gloomhaven", "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Aeon's End"}], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1562716949.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "domain": "self.boardgames", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of my board game time in the past 10 years has been 2-player with my wife. Once we were introduced to Pandemic, co-op games have been our bread and butter. We&amp;#39;ll mix in the occasional game of Terraforming Mars or Concordia, but co-op games seem to be the ideal game for many couples - and we fit that mold. We&amp;#39;ve had a lot of enjoyment lately playing co-op deck builders in particular, so I thought I&amp;#39;d share what we&amp;#39;ve learned so far. I&amp;#39;ll talk about these games roughly from least to most favorite. There are a couple of games in this list that might not fit the definition exactly, but this is my post, so I&amp;#39;ll do what I want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First up is &lt;strong&gt;Shadowrun: Crossfire&lt;/strong&gt; (10 plays). This game has the structure of a great deck builder, but fails in the execution. I really liked the theme - the mix of futuristic tech and magic was very cool (I understand there is a Shadowrun universe, but I know nothing about it). The game had some neat little elements - a campaign like structure where you can earn perks to make your character stronger, which allows you to attempt harder missions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s failings were critical for us, however. Lots of co-op games are swingy because of card draw, but S:C pretty much takes the cake. You can have insta-lose right away due to bad card draw, or you can feel good about yourself and then get massacred in one turn. I like my co-ops hard, but reasonably so - I don&amp;#39;t want to have to grind out the same mission over and over to gain perks. It&amp;#39;s a board game, not a video game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You might like this if&lt;/em&gt;: you like losing a lot, you love the Shadowrun universe, insta-lose is your friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle&lt;/strong&gt; (20 plays) is an interesting one. This game is the best bad game I&amp;#39;ve every played. As a family of Harry Potter fanatics, buying this game was a no-brainer, but my expectations were low. Once we got into it, we found numerous things that we loved, and just as many that we hated. Essentially, it is a great game that is fundamentally broken. You can read &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8bqqyz/harry_potter_hogwarts_battle_is_the_best_bad_game/\"&gt;my specific thoughts here&lt;/a&gt;, but to sum up: 1. Poor player count scaling, 2. No categories/tiers of villains or cards, 3. The Spiral of Death.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But on the plus side, it&amp;#39;s got some really good mechanics that incorporate everything you love from the Harry Potter universe. (If you&amp;#39;re interested, here&amp;#39;s a link to my &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/8bziei/harry_potter_hogwarts_battle_house_rules/\"&gt;post about house rules for the game&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You might like this if&lt;/em&gt;: you love Harry Potter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shadowrift&lt;/strong&gt; (5 plays), is my newest find in the co-op deck builder category. You should take my comments with a grain of salt because A) I&amp;#39;ve only played 5 times, and B) There is a revised 2nd Edition I&amp;#39;ve never seen (I acquired a 1st edition copy). In this game you are heroes defending a town from invading monsters, who apparently are coming in through a rift. You can win by either building walls around the town, or sealing the rifts. There are a couple of clever mechanics in this game, notably the Town and Traveler cards. Instead of just having a town with health points, you are actually constructing a deck of townspeople by hiring villagers to join the town. On your turn, you can use the abilities of the townsfolk to assist you in your fight. However, when the monsters kill someone in the town, they are replaced by Corpses, which (as you may guess) aren&amp;#39;t great.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a neat take on the genre, and I like the decision space it provides for you. There is a variable market of cards to buy from, and the base game comes with 5 (6?) enemies to fight. Overall, it&amp;#39;s an entertaining game with more good than bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue I&amp;#39;ve had with the game is that you mix one Shadowrift per player into the monster deck of 20 cards. When those pop up makes a huge difference in winning. Too early and the game is a cake walk, too late and you might not survive. But compared to some of the other games, that issue isn&amp;#39;t a game breaker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would absolutely recommend trying to grab a copy in a trade on the cheap (heck, there&amp;#39;s even a &lt;a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/product/1880465\"&gt;copy available for $1 plus shipping&lt;/a&gt; right now). I understand that there&amp;#39;s a 2nd Edition with expansions and more content, but the price tag seems high to me. I&amp;#39;m expecting to get 20+ plays out of it and then move it in a trade. I don&amp;#39;t see it as a long term game without more content.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You might like this if&lt;/em&gt;: you want to play around with an interesting shared deck mechanic, you like trying out fun new games that won&amp;#39;t take over your life&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, speaking of taking over your life, let&amp;#39;s talk about &lt;strong&gt;Legendary: Marvel&lt;/strong&gt; (10 plays). I&amp;#39;m just going to lump all the flavors of Legendary together and call them Legendary: Marvel. There is a huge amount of content in the Legendary game universe, so you can explore it as deeply as you wish. Essentially every game you have a starting hand, there is a random market of cards, there are villains, and there&amp;#39;s a big bad to fight. Every fight is slightly different due to the various mechanics brought to the table by your setup. Every game I&amp;#39;ve played of this has been enjoyable but not spectacular. In general it&amp;#39;s a well tuned system that feels just a bit too sterile to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My friend owns lots of content for this game, and we always joke that playing Legendary is 3 games in 1. Game 1: Assemble the cards, Game 2: Play the game, Game 3: Sort all the cards and put everything away again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You might like this if&lt;/em&gt;: you love the IP, you have an organization fetish&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, before you yell at me that &lt;strong&gt;Sentinels of the Multiverse&lt;/strong&gt; (12 plays) isn&amp;#39;t a deck builder, let me just say this: You&amp;#39;re correct. However, it feels so much like these other games that I feel it is legal to include this in the list. If you are looking for a co-op deck builder to play, SotM might be the game you love. Sentinels has a few amazing things going for it, and one big downside. The positives first: Awesome theme - just a wonderful comic book world that you get to play in. Great decks - instead of building a deck as you go, each hero has their own pre-constructed deck. And boy does each deck play differently. You get a real sense of how each hero is a different character by what they can do with their cards. Super quick to set up - grab hero decks, bad guy deck, environment deck, and your tokens. Bam! Ready to play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did I say &amp;quot;tokens&amp;quot;? Ah, yes, to the negative - saying that Sentinels is a bit fiddly is like saying Campaign for North Africa runs a bit long. I&amp;#39;m getting ready to attack and I have a +1 Damage token on my guy, and there&amp;#39;s another +1 Damage token ... is that for me, or only when attacking the Environment? Wait, why is that +1 Damage Taken token there? Did the card that brought that into play get discarded or not? What type of damage did he do? Am I immune to fire or not?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not insurmountable, and it definitely gets easier with multiple plays, but managing the tokens and health is a barrier to enjoying the game. If that sounds frustrating, don&amp;#39;t even try this game. But if you can get over that hurdle, Sentinels offers some truly great experiences with very fun, thematic cards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You might like this if&lt;/em&gt;: you like superheroes, cool combos, and are fine with fiddly mechanics&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, you thought I was cheating with Sentinels? How about this - my next game is &lt;strong&gt;Orleans: Invasion&lt;/strong&gt; (20 plays), a game that doesn&amp;#39;t even have cards! Before you string me up by my meeples, hear me out: Orleans is a bag builder, and a bag builder is simply a modified deck builder. I&amp;#39;m including it because I find this game definitely scratches some of the same itches of the other games on this list. You&amp;#39;re working together, building up an engine, trying to beat the Big Bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In order to play the cooperative version of Orleans, you need the base game plus The Invasion expansion. On the one hand, that&amp;#39;s a relatively big investment; on the other hand, you also have the exceptional base game of Orleans to play. The Invasion expansion does a masterful job of turning a purely competitive game into a cooperative experience. Each player gets their own role which requires them to achieve different goals along with the group goals. The roles change every game, and the random events change, so the puzzle is different every time. Difficulty can easily be scaled up or down. We have had numerous games that came down to the last turn, which is exactly what I want in a co-op.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You might like this if&lt;/em&gt;: you like bag building, you like Orleans&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m saving the best for last, so it&amp;#39;s time for &lt;strong&gt;Aeon&amp;#39;s End&lt;/strong&gt; (150+ plays). I won&amp;#39;t deny that I&amp;#39;m a fanboy. Aeon&amp;#39;s End has marched all the way up to be my #1 favorite game of all time. I own all content, and backed the latest Kickstarter. So at least you know where I&amp;#39;m coming from here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Aeon&amp;#39;s End, you play mages who are trying to defend Gravehold from an attacking Nemesis. The primary strength of AE is the incredible variability you get with the different types of Mages, Nemeses, and market cards. Every game feels unique and different - a mage that might work well against one Nemesis could fall flat against a different one. My wife and I like to do a completely randomized setup, and then tweak it if we end up in a battle we can&amp;#39;t win.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mechanically, Aeon&amp;#39;s End is a finely tuned machine. The vast majority of the games we&amp;#39;ve played have been entertaining and close. You feel like you&amp;#39;re getting stronger, which is good because you know the minions get stronger as well. The Nemesis deck is built in tiers. Each Nemesis has their own unique cards, and those are mixed in with a random collection of basic cards. These are stacked with the easiest tier on top. The criticism could be: &amp;quot;It takes longer to set up.&amp;quot; However, I will take a slightly longer setup time that gives me a better overall experience instead of the insta-lose games you can have with HP:HB or Shadowrun. And you are rarely put in a no-win situation. Even games where we lose in the mid-game are winnable with a strategy change. Most of the time we just reset the game and give it another go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, Aeon&amp;#39;s End is simply cool. You have to open breaches to create more space to play more spells. You choose between gems, relics, and spells to buy to get the perfect deck. You can also charge up the special ability that only your mage has. The pace, flow, and feel of the game just sing for me. (Important note: I vastly prefer AE at 2P over 3 or 4. I just feel you get more powerful and can do more cool things at the lower player count.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are two important mechanics to mention. 1. A deck builder with no shuffling. It&amp;#39;s a cool thing, because this game expects you to pack your discard pile to get powerful combos. It adds interesting decisions on when to buy a card, or when to hold cards in your hand for the next turn. 2. Variable turn order. At 2P, everybody (each mage and the Nemesis) get 2 turn order cards. Those 6 cards are shuffled and flipped to determine who goes when. It makes a procedural game more dynamic.

Custom made would be cool because then I&amp;#39;d have all 3 custom made, and floor boards are cool just because they are massive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: changed the link to a better set of photos&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/IyGo237v9sU_v6lS4hdoailCYIhR6IeB-SsZ2cx0g18.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=32ab1372dc8869c283afa2048535864332270c69", "width": 3024, "height": 4032}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/IyGo237v9sU_v6lS4hdoailCYIhR6IeB-SsZ2cx0g18.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96c6f6aa73420764a8cc78beb20d7cfb5fd7c236", "width": 108, "height": 144}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/IyGo237v9sU_v6lS4hdoailCYIhR6IeB-SsZ2cx0g18.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69a12e8deac4100e24588f2277876e8df6f0f2c1", "width": 216, "height": 288}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/IyGo237v9sU_v6lS4hdoailCYIhR6IeB-SsZ2cx0g18.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61dc954adbfd6e6ebfb900c775ccb58b7d76411e", "width": 320, "height": 426}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/IyGo237v9sU_v6lS4hdoailCYIhR6IeB-SsZ2cx0g18.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a60bf543397bba437b7fd7b78e76940e2fff28e", "width": 640, "height": 853}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/IyGo237v9sU_v6lS4hdoailCYIhR6IeB-SsZ2cx0g18.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11e82315984a3cc6ecdf165371cd9ffc4bbdce4a", "width": 960, "height": 1280}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/IyGo237v9sU_v6lS4hdoailCYIhR6IeB-SsZ2cx0g18.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5244400856a19f2e7e1ab019981813d9f960cf1c", "width": 1080, "height": 1440}], "variants": {}, "id": "VWQKieBpavxSGQ7qpvROLEd2VyyvBrgH_4mn8bIYpj4"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "734914a6-426b-11e8-8511-0e863647358e", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": "El Grande", "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "cbb5un", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "NanchoMan", "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 13, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/boardgames/comments/cbb5un/comc_heres_my_abstract_strategy_table/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/cbb5un/comc_heres_my_abstract_strategy_table/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2056538, "created_utc": 1562728214.0, "discussion_type": null, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "boardgames", "selftext": "So I've been playing mansions of madness on and off with 2 other friends, and routinely we find the game is extremely difficult or ponderous to play.
