previous thread:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c38bqg/board\\_game\\_ideas\\_for\\_a\\_project/](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c38bqg/board_game_ideas_for_a_project/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nand there were a lot of excellent ideas in there, but unfortunatly we ended up just taking the card game \"war\" and doing a variant of it, it goes exactly like the original war game only it's in duos and the sum of the 2 cards drawn are the winners, and the cards were suppose to be massive to connec to the major theme.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur instructor cut us down really hard and said we basically did nothing , we just added a dumb mechanic to an already existing game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I am inclined to agree with him, our game had basically no actual mechanics , it was luck based and the math thing were you need to calculate the sum only subtracted from the game itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo , here we are , basically 2 weeks from presenting our final project and we're basically holding our d\\*\\*\\*\\* in our hands.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, my friend helped me brew an idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The game is played by an X amout of people (I am leaning towards 4 or 5).\n2. The game is a take on the \"trouble in terrorist town\" mode for counter strike.\n3. The game has rogue like / like mechanics , if the team dies it's game over , there are no do overs.\n4. The game board is basically a maze with a lot of rooms , each room is numbered.\n5. The point of the game is to obtain the treasure.\n6. The game players will be divided in the beginning of each round to \"Good\" and \"Bad\" players, this would be done by each player drawing a card at the beginning of the game , no one can see the cards  , and your cards labels you as good or bad.\n7. The good players are supposed to help the team obtain the treasure.\n8. The bad players are supposed to kill the team and prevent them from obtaining the treasure.\n9. Each player has 5 or 6 cards , the cards are basically the building blocks of the play area itself , for example: I am a bad player , I drew 6 random cards and one of them are telling me that in room 5 there are a swarm of monsters and if we enter this room without sufficent provisions or armor or whatever than the team dies , I then have to do my best to lead my team to this room.\n10. The team progress as a single entity , there are no individual choices in the game , the game is progressed only when the MAJORITY of players have decided on a path to take.\n11. The actual progression is done by using a dice , and depending on the numbers that got rolled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is basically the structure of the game, but I know I am missing some crucial stuff like how to shuffle the cards, good cards with bad cards? 2 individual stacks would be too conspicuous and the point is that no one can know who you are as a player ( good or bad ) right at the start of the round.\n\nAnother thing I am trobuled by is how we make the group progress without making it obvious that one player is trying to kill the team , for example if the dice landed on 6 and door number 4 is on the path , and one player REALLY INSISTS that we go there, it can cause the other players to suspect him and make him out to be a bad guy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso , if anyone can spot any more problems and that can be pointed out  I would really appriciate it.\n\nGood ideas for improvement are also appriciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game has to be played in intervals of 15-20 minutes per round.\n\nAnd the theme of the game has to be \"major\" (and the word itself must be used subtly).", "author_fullname": "t2_hwpp2", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Some constructive criticism about my idea for a board game?

I have never used the Mechanical Marquise due to online reactions to how it played, but I can say I couldn't be more thrilled with the new version.\n\nOur game consisted of the Corvids, the Vagabond, and the Lizard Cult. We didn't really consider that these factions would have good synergy, but they truly did. We didn't know what difficulty to use for the MM 2.0, so we used \"Challenging\" (she recruits 5 warriors each turn instead of 4). We reverted to normal difficulty halfway through the game when we were getting steamrolled. I didn't have qualms about changing the difficulty mid-game-- the point of this experience was to have fun. And have fun we did!\n\nThe **Lizard** player was probably the MVP-- able to sanctify and convert MM pieces to manipulate who and where she would attack. We were able to strategically discard to ensure the Lizards always had a beneficial Hated suit, which made their turns much more fun. The MM 2.0 is relentless militarily, but that was a great thing for the Lizards-- I've never seen so many Acolytes on a LC board. The matchup really supercharged the faction and made it much more fun to play.\n\nAs the **Corvid** player, I had trouble keeping plots on the board due to the MM's aggression. The Lizard player was able to give me cover and ensure that he would be attacked, not me, while I was setting up Bomb plots in essential MM strongholds. With one plot, I was able to remove 3 buildings, 3 pieces of wood, and 9 warriors. It was extremely satisfying, and the three of us coordinating to pull it off felt very cinematic. This was the turning point of the game where the MM's scoring slowed down significantly and we were able to build scoring momentum.\n\nThe **Vagabond** player was mostly there for support. I'm not sure I'd recommend the Vagabond for a Bot game with the MM after this match, but it may have been his choice of Vagabond that was the problem (he was the Ranger). He mostly used his two crossbows to thin out MM clearings to help me and the Lizard player set up big plays. He also was helpful in giving the Lizard player tons of cards, which translated into big turns. The MM may have been why the Vagabond didn't work well; the fact that she was hostile (and present in almost every clearing) made movement for the Vagabond very difficult. This slowed down his questing, and we had to work hard to make sure he could get to the clearings he needed to aid us and complete quests.\n\nThere were some **rules questions** that arose that didn't seem to be handled by the Rootbotics rulebook. Namely, \"enemy\" is not defined when you're playing a co-op game. For instance, when I used a bomb on that clearing, should I also have destroyed all the Lizard cult pieces? The house rule was that we were not each others' enemies, but could target each other with hostile abilities if desired. For instance, I could battle the Lizard and help him generate acolytes. This rule was mainly to enable Favor of the X cards and Bomb Maker plots, which otherwise would set the team back considerably. If you play co-op, I think this is a good rule to prevent illogical gameplay results.\n\nI can't wait to get my group back to the table to try out one of the other 3 bots. It felt like a very brief tabletop RPG campaign, where we felt like we were honestly embodying the most interesting aspects of our factions. My crow warriors would pop up unexpectedly to sabotage some unattended Marquise buildings. The Lizard cult was able to spread propaganda and turn MM's forces against her. The Vagabond was scurrying for his life to supply the other factions of the forest. The MM was tremendously powerful in the early game, barreling ahead on the core track until we were able to get a foothold and mount a resistance.

size is completely arbitrary so any roll is sufficient to get to the other side of the board.)\n\nWhile the active player (from now on referred to as the \"attacker\") is moving, the inactive player (the \"defender\") can block by putting their piece in front of the attacking player's piece as they move.\n\nWhen the defending player blocks, the attacking player destroys all the pieces of the defending player.

To do this, the defending player says \"Actually, I was rebuilding\" and places a piece of their color on top of their stack of pieces. After rebuilding, the attack stops and the turn passes to the defending player.\n\nThe attacking player has an option when the defender rebuilds, their special move. To do this, the attacker takes their stack of pieces in the air above the defending player's pieces and slams them down, destroying all pieces in the defender's stack.
