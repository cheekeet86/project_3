The kids claimed to want to play it again, but as the person who generally gets games out, I certainly wasn\u2019t going to suggest Catan.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently I read someone\u2019s personal rule for buying a new game, which includes playing at least 10 games of things you already have or play each game you have once before buying a new one.  I thought that was a great idea and would certainly help me not get out of hand buying more games than we could play.  Well, in putting that into effect for myself, Catan has to come up sooner than later.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We gave it another shot last night and had a great time!  The game moved along much more fluidly, and I think because we are used to playing games now, we just played together better.  Catan may not be the most exciting game to discuss anymore, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was fun.  Now that everyone will associate the game with a positive experience I think it will get played a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "cedg57", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "txbluelacy", "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 51, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/boardgames/comments/cedg57/first_actually_fun_game_of_catan/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/cedg57/first_actually_fun_game_of_catan/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2056539, "created_utc": 1563373093.0, "discussion_type": null, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "boardgames", "selftext": "I recently got \"Monopoly Ultimate but the game didn't come with instructions; would anyone have a pdf copy/picture to share with me?

I had played games before, but didn\u2019t start buying and really playing until around this time. In June 2017, I downloaded BG Stats and started recording my plays. On July 16, 2019, I hit 100 unique games played. This is my ranking of those games.\n\n \n\n100\\. **Munchkin** - 1 Play - I don\u2019t know how a game this simple can have such a bad set of rules? I don\u2019t know how a game with such a bad set of rules got so popular? I don\u2019t know how a game this popular is so bad. I bought this game on a whim on vacation because it was early in my days in the hobby and thought, \u201call these people can\u2019t be wrong.\u201d I read the rules and instantly wondered what the point was. Munchkin will continue to print money and I\u2019m happy for them, but this isn\u2019t for me. I\u2019ll refuse to play.\n\n \n\n99\\. **Monopoly Gamer** - 1 Play \u2013 This is still Monopoly, people. I bought this for my nephew for Christmas, so of course I had to play a game with him. While, the theme is awesome, the components are awesome, this game has no decisions. At least it was quick.\n\n \n\n98\\. **Holding On: The Troubled Life of Billy Kerr** - 4 Plays \u2013 One of my biggest disappointments in my board gaming life. I\u2019m a sucker for unique theme and this had such an interesting one for me. The mechanics, however, are absolute trash. This is a luck fest, and if you fail a mission, you have to do it over and over and over and over again until you beat it. The story did seem cool, but you\u2019re looking at the same cards every game and it was such a slog to get through. This game is for sale, if you\u2019d like to try it after this glowing review.\n\n \n\n97\\. **Unicorn Glitterluck: Cloud Stacking** - 4 Plays \u2013 In sentimental value, this game is top 10. I bought this for my 2 year old daughter at Origins this year and she was so excited I brought her a game home. She always likes playing with my pieces, but now she had one of her own. She made it a point that it had to be on daddy\u2019s shelf. I\u2019ll cherish my memories of that moment and my plays of it, but this is still a game for toddlers.\n\n \n\n96\\. **One Night Ultimate Werewolf** - 1 Play \u2013 1 play was enough for me, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get comments saying it requires multiple plays. I don\u2019t like that it\u2019s 10 minutes. It\u2019s social deduction, but no way to deduce who\u2019s good and who\u2019s bad socially. It starts with a guess and then 2 minutes of pandering. I would play this in a group if someone reallllly wanted to, but it just doesn\u2019t interest me.\n\n \n\n95\\. **Jenga** - 4 Plays \u2013 The only way to play Jenga is to play Drinking Jenga. Put different tasks on each brick, when it\u2019s pulled, whoever pulls it, does the task. My personal favorite block in my set is \u201cSecret Terrorist\u201d. The person who pulls it, writes down a word. If that word is said by any other player, they smack the tower as hard as they can.\n\n \n\n94\\. **Kingdom Builder** - 1 Play \u2013 Dave Luza is correct. This game is literal trash.\n\n \n\n93\\. **Tokaido** - 9 Plays \u2013 Pretty game, cool theme, blah, blah, blah. This game is just kind of\u2026boring. Others describe it as chill. The expansion makes it a tiny bit better, but the choices are so easy. Go to the closest spot always, get points for everything. This was a gift and looks good on my shelf, only reason it stays. Can someone please tell me why this game gets so much love?\n\n \n\n92\\. **Small World** - 4 Plays (recorded) - One of my first favorite games. It reminded me a lot of my childhood favorite, Risk. I may say this more than once, I\u2019m not sure, but VARIABILITY DOES NOT EQUAL REPLAYABILITY. The monster + power combos create variability, but they\u2019re all pretty much the same. The area control is mundane and you really never have enough to hold on to anything. And I have to mention that you spend 1/3 of the game declining and not playing the game.\n\n \n\n91\\. **Ex Libris** - 2 Plays \u2013 Another huge disappointment for me. A game I was looking forward to for a long time because of the really unique them. This game has so much going on for how light it is. The worker placement is annoying because you\u2019re constantly needing to read new buildings, even though they\u2019re all pretty much the same. Remember, variability does not equal replayability (that was fast). Every spot is get more cards or rearrange your shelf. I like the tableau building with the books, but that adds about 5 things to remember for scoring too. You have to think about tableau building which scores for 3-5 different things, 10 placement spots that are constantly revolving, variable player powers for different workers for each player.

I bought this game on a whim on vacation because it was early in my days in the hobby and thought, \u201call these people can\u2019t be wrong.\u201d I read the rules and instantly wondered what the point was. Munchkin will continue to print money and I\u2019m happy for them, but this isn\u2019t for me. I\u2019ll refuse to play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;99. &lt;strong&gt;Monopoly Gamer&lt;/strong&gt; - 1 Play \u2013 This is still Monopoly, people. I bought this for my nephew for Christmas, so of course I had to play a game with him. While, the theme is awesome, the components are awesome, this game has no decisions. At least it was quick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;98. &lt;strong&gt;Holding On: The Troubled Life of Billy Kerr&lt;/strong&gt; - 4 Plays \u2013 One of my biggest disappointments in my board gaming life. I\u2019m a sucker for unique theme and this had such an interesting one for me. The mechanics, however, are absolute trash. This is a luck fest, and if you fail a mission, you have to do it over and over and over and over again until you beat it. The story did seem cool, but you\u2019re looking at the same cards every game and it was such a slog to get through. This game is for sale, if you\u2019d like to try it after this glowing review.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;97. &lt;strong&gt;Unicorn Glitterluck: Cloud Stacking&lt;/strong&gt; - 4 Plays \u2013 In sentimental value, this game is top 10. I bought this for my 2 year old daughter at Origins this year and she was so excited I brought her a game home. She always likes playing with my pieces, but now she had one of her own. She made it a point that it had to be on daddy\u2019s shelf. I\u2019ll cherish my memories of that moment and my plays of it, but this is still a game for toddlers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;96. &lt;strong&gt;One Night Ultimate Werewolf&lt;/strong&gt; - 1 Play \u2013 1 play was enough for me, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get comments saying it requires multiple plays. I don\u2019t like that it\u2019s 10 minutes. It\u2019s social deduction, but no way to deduce who\u2019s good and who\u2019s bad socially. It starts with a guess and then 2 minutes of pandering. I would play this in a group if someone reallllly wanted to, but it just doesn\u2019t interest me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;95. &lt;strong&gt;Jenga&lt;/strong&gt; - 4 Plays \u2013 The only way to play Jenga is to play Drinking Jenga. Put different tasks on each brick, when it\u2019s pulled, whoever pulls it, does the task. My personal favorite block in my set is \u201cSecret Terrorist\u201d. The person who pulls it, writes down a word. If that word is said by any other player, they smack the tower as hard as they can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;94. &lt;strong&gt;Kingdom Builder&lt;/strong&gt; - 1 Play \u2013 Dave Luza is correct. This game is literal trash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;93. &lt;strong&gt;Tokaido&lt;/strong&gt; - 9 Plays \u2013 Pretty game, cool theme, blah, blah, blah. This game is just kind of\u2026boring. Others describe it as chill. The expansion makes it a tiny bit better, but the choices are so easy. Go to the closest spot always, get points for everything. This was a gift and looks good on my shelf, only reason it stays. Can someone please tell me why this game gets so much love?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;92. &lt;strong&gt;Small World&lt;/strong&gt; - 4 Plays (recorded) - One of my first favorite games. It reminded me a lot of my childhood favorite, Risk. I may say this more than once, I\u2019m not sure, but VARIABILITY DOES NOT EQUAL REPLAYABILITY. The monster + power combos create variability, but they\u2019re all pretty much the same. The area control is mundane and you really never have enough to hold on to anything. And I have to mention that you spend 1/3 of the game declining and not playing the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;91. &lt;strong&gt;Ex Libris&lt;/strong&gt; - 2 Plays \u2013 Another huge disappointment for me. A game I was looking forward to for a long time because of the really unique them. This game has so much going on for how light it is. The worker placement is annoying because you\u2019re constantly needing to read new buildings, even though they\u2019re all pretty much the same. Remember, variability does not equal replayability (that was fast). Every spot is get more cards or rearrange your shelf. I like the tableau building with the books, but that adds about 5 things to remember for scoring too. You have to think about tableau building which scores for 3-5 different things, 10 placement spots that are constantly revolving, variable player powers for different workers for each player. It\u2019s just so much for such a light game&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": "Scythe", "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "cefse3", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cbjking", "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 58, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/boardgames/comments/cefse3/the_top_100_that_no_one_asked_for_10091/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/cefse3/the_top_100_that_no_one_asked_for_10091/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2056539, "created_utc": 1563383732.0, "discussion_type": null, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "boardgames", "selftext": "Hi,\n\nSo I posted about this 4-5 months ago to r/dota2 to show people the idea; however, what I had back then needed a lot of work.
