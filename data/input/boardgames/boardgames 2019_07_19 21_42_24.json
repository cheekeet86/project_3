Gonna test it on the weekend.  \n\n\nFor the future I also put Terra Mystica and Spirit Island on my list fore more complex games that can be played when we have more time and look for something more challenging.  \n\n\n**Kingdomino:**  \nNow that you know a little about our background, I found out about Kingdomino just recently and thought about adding it to the collection of games that can be quickly explained and started with guests.  \nBut we want to be able to also play games when we are more then 4.  \n\n\nSo we were wondering if we should get 2x Kingdomino or 1x Kingdomino and 1x Queendomino.  \n\n\nI read that many don't like Queendomino because it takes away the simplicity of Kingdomino.  \nBut i myself like it a little more complex and was wondering if it would be so much more difficult to teach it to new players.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf we go for 2x Kingdomino i'm afraight that it could get boring too quick.  \nBut when we get 1 King and 1 Queen i was wondering if it would become to complicated to quickly start with new players.  \n\n\nThough i guess that if we'd start with King + Queen with more then 4 players, we could play 1 round without the queen rules to introduce them to the base mechanics and then add the queen rules. The first round the red tiles would be completely useless but i think for the purpose of teaching that would be fine.  \n\n\nSo what are your thoughts someone who is just starting with boardgames should get?  \n2x King or 1 King and 1 Queen?", "author_fullname": "t2_voqdu9k", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Kingdomino (x2) or King + Queendomino for 4+ players", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_c6ijhm", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1561746269.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.boardgames", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, i am just starting to build a small collection of board games and looking for some great games.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am looking for games that you can learn quick and play right away even with new players.&lt;br/&gt;\nBut at the same time having played many PC games with a lot of complexity&lt;br/&gt;\n(Strategy like Civilizations, ARPGs like Diablo II and Path of Exile and games like Factorio).&lt;br/&gt;\nSo i also love complex game mechanics.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started about 2-3 weeks ago looking for something one could play when we have guests.&lt;br/&gt;\nFirst thing i bought is Machi Koro which checks al the marks we were looking for.&lt;br/&gt;\nEasy to teach, quick to start and beginners don&amp;#39;t get destroyed by experienced players.&lt;br/&gt;\nOnly negative thing is that sometimes you get so many buildings that you need a lot of space on the table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then just recently i bought Carcassonne which i think can be perfect because it&amp;#39;s still easy to teach and you can start quick enough while it has more complexity which i like.

Like FORTRESS, FORTUNE requires you to get specific combinations of cards.  And like FEAR, it requires you to compare hands when something is triggered. But it's the combination of these elements that makes FORTUNE feel new.\n\nOnce again the \"fable system\" of this game means that you learn how to play it on the fly, with special cards explaining the rules.  Much of the fun is about discovering how the game ebbs and flows as new rules get added, and the trajectory of the game-play keeps altering.

I\u2019m back with another semi-weekly article on the journey of creating a home-brew Spirit. After coming up with an idea for a Spirit, I had to do additional research in order to make sure that the idea fit thematically.\n\n**Thematic Research**\n\nI started with a simple google search. Something along the lines of \u201cphenomenon found in deserts\u201d and went from there. From the list of resulting sites I made a list of ideas that could potentially be used to create a desert/antlion based Spirit:\n\n* Oasis\n* Mirage\n* Haboob/Sandstorm\n* Desert Heat\n* Cactus\n* Desert Varnish\n* Flash Floods\n* Quicksand\n\nThen I decided to figure out the play style. My initial reaction was to embrace the antlion fantasy of gathering in Invaders and then destroying them. Both would most likely be Innate Powers. In order to facilitate that, I needed a Special Rule (or two) that would allow the theme to come through into the mechanical realm of the game.\n\nSo I settled on the following Special Rules:\n\n1. Presence can only be placed in the Sands.\n2. When Presence is placed, gather 1 Explorer or 1 Town or 1 Dahan into that same land.\n   1. Note: The astute player will notice that there is definitely something wrong with this Special Rule, but we\u2019ll get into that in a later article.\n\nThen I decided to get a little weird and add one more that I thought might be interesting.\n\n* Plant and Water Elements count as Sun instead.\n\nI wanted the Spirit to be unique and play differently, and to me this last rule would help set it up to be different enough from the other Spirits because it would most likely contain high numbers of Sun Elements in its Innate Power Element thresholds. I was fascinated by the idea of having a Spirit whose final Innate Power Element threshold was something around the magnitude of 10 Sun Elements to trigger. A card that provided a Sun, Water, and Plant Symbol would instead generate 3 Sun Elements. You\u2019ll see how this Special Rule fared in future articles.\n\nSo now that I had a basic idea of Special Rules and some ideas for Innate Powers, I went back to the thematic research and began crafting the Unique Power Cards. I took the same list and jotted down ideas for each thing:\n\n* Oasis\n   * Remove a blight\n   * Gather Invaders\n   * Gather Dahan\n* Mirage\n   * Fear\n   * Gather Invaders\n* Haboob/Sandstorm\n   * Destroy Explorers\n   * Destroy Towns\n   * Fear\n   * Push Explorers\n   * Push Towns\n   * Defend\n   * Skip Actions\n* Desert Heat\n   * Deal damage with extra in Sands\n* Cactus\n   * Wilds tokens\n   * Defend\n* Desert Varnish\n   * Defend\n* Flash Floods\n   * Ultimately decided against trying to describe this one since River had a Flash Flood card already.\n* Quicksand\n   * Defend\n   * Wilds\n   * Beasts\n   * Destroy Explorers\n   * Fear\n* Singing Sand Dunes (Look it up, it\u2019s pretty cool)\n   * Gather Explorers\n   * Fear\n\nI did realize at a later date that Quicksand isn\u2019t actually a desert thing (as portrayed in movies) since its composition requires a decent amount of water, which isn\u2019t something that deserts are particularly rife with. Hindsight is 20/20, so I decided to go with it at the beginning since it seemed so versatile.\n\nI\u2019m a Computer Scientist by trade and I find that naming things is incredibly difficult sometimes. As such, I waffled all over the place trying to come up with a name for this Spirit. I really wanted it to have a name like Shifting Sands Consume the Lost, or Shifting Sands Devours the Doomed, but the alliterations were killing me. I threw around other weird names like Shifting Sand\u2019s Black Blizzard, or even Desert As An All Consuming Void (blech). It was really hard. Then I finally settled on **Shifting Desert\u2019s Gaping Maw**. It just felt right saying it and reading it on paper, so that\u2019s what I went with. The name has grown on me since then and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll change it.\n\nNow with a name and some basic ideas of thematic elements I could use to bring the Spirit to life, I moved on to the next step, creating the first (very rough) draft.\n\nInitial Ideas Chosen for Unique Power Cards:\n\n* Bottomless Pits of Quicksand\n   * 3 Cost, Fast, Range 1 from Sand, Any land\n   * Defend 4\n   * Destroy 1 Explorer\n   * Add 1 Wilds\n   * Elements: Water/Earth (Water = Sun)\n* Scorch with Desert Heat\n   * 2 Cost, Slow, Range 1 from Sand, Any land\n   * 1 Damage\n   * \\+1 Damage if target land is Sand\n   * Elements: Sun/Fire/Air\n* Singing Dunes of Sand\n   * 2 Cost, Slow, Range 1 from Sand, Any land\n   * 2 Fear\n   * Gather up to 2 Explorers\n   * Elements: Earth/Sun\n* Thrashing Walls of Sand\n   * 2 Cost, Slow, Range 1 from Sand, Any land\n   * Destroy 1 Explorer and 1 Town\n   * Elements: Air/Sun\n\nNOTE: Anyone who plays the game regularly will most likely find some things wrong with the above Power Cards just with a cursory glance.\n\nAgain, all names are WIP and most of them aren't even what I'm using now, it just goes to show how dynamic and changing the process was for me at the beginning.\n\nThis article will be limited to the draft of the Power Cards and some links on how to get your own templates to use for your own purposes.\n\nHere's the [Power Card Template](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/180640/power-card-front-template-file) that I used as well as the [Spirit Panel Template](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/180025/spirit-panel-play-side-template-file). A huge shout out to BGG user Latzko and his amazing work in making these templates (as well as the others users that have contributed to the process).\n\nNote: The files are in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic) format, so open it with whatever preferred software you have for it (Photoshop or something else). I downloaded Inkscape (and it's what was recommended in Latzko's post) and it has been a useful tool if you're not opposed to free open source applications.\n\nThe Power Card Template is pretty straightforward, you just need to download it and you're good to start using it after unzipping it from the archive. Just open it in Inkscape (or other program) and you can start working on it. A note, you will want to install the fonts that come in the zip archive to get what seems to be the closest font to what is officially used.\n\nThe Spirit Panel Template's directions aren't quite as obvious. I'll list out what each file is for and the format:\n\n* Part 1 - Zip Archive that contains the SVG file, a README to help with explaining, and 4 font archives.\n* Part 2 - It's a 002 Format, which isn't anything your computer will recognize. Just put it in the same place as the SVG file from Part 1\n* Part 3 - It's a 003 Format, so do the same thing.\n* Part 4 - It's a 004 Format, so do the same thing once more.\n\nAfter that, with everything in the same folder, you're good to just open the SVG file in Inkscape and go from there. Latzko has provided a wonderful tutorial on the different aspects on the template and how to use it if you have questions.\n\nSo with that, I had made the (very) rough draft of the starting Unique Power Cards. In the next article I'll walk you through the process of creating the Spirit Board, including Growth option, Presence Tracks, Elemental thresholds, Innate Powers, and the reasoning behind all of it. Depending on how long that article is, I may even go into the first play-testing session where I learned that I new very little about balance.\n\nUntil then, see you all next time.", "author_fullname": "t2_nqwfg", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Spirit Island Home-brew - Pt. 2 - Creating the Thematic Design", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_c64wqe", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 63, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": "2fdfa772-9cf0-11e8-922c-0e3a76b3c6b0", "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 63, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1562589593.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"a": ":spirit_island:", "e": "emoji", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/5dhccdeqncf11_t5_2qmjp/spirit_island"}, {"e": "text", "t": " Heart of the Wildfire"}], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1561667249.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "domain": "self.boardgames", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c4mxeg/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_1_intro_and_initial/\"&gt;Part 1 -  Intro and Initial Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c7s2pn/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_3_the_first_rough_draft/\"&gt;Part 3 - The First Rough Draft and Play-Test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c922pk/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_4_back_to_the_drawing/\"&gt;Part 4 - Back to the Drawing Board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/cakhsi/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_5_final_iterate_iterate/\"&gt;Part 5 (Final) - Iterate, Iterate, Iterate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey all.

In order to facilitate that, I needed a Special Rule (or two) that would allow the theme to come through into the mechanical realm of the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I settled on the following Special Rules:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Presence can only be placed in the Sands.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When Presence is placed, gather 1 Explorer or 1 Town or 1 Dahan into that same land.\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Note: The astute player will notice that there is definitely something wrong with this Special Rule, but we\u2019ll get into that in a later article.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I decided to get a little weird and add one more that I thought might be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Plant and Water Elements count as Sun instead.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted the Spirit to be unique and play differently, and to me this last rule would help set it up to be different enough from the other Spirits because it would most likely contain high numbers of Sun Elements in its Innate Power Element thresholds. I was fascinated by the idea of having a Spirit whose final Innate Power Element threshold was something around the magnitude of 10 Sun Elements to trigger. A card that provided a Sun, Water, and Plant Symbol would instead generate 3 Sun Elements. You\u2019ll see how this Special Rule fared in future articles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now that I had a basic idea of Special Rules and some ideas for Innate Powers, I went back to the thematic research and began crafting the Unique Power Cards. I took the same list and jotted down ideas for each thing:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Oasis\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Remove a blight&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gather Invaders&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gather Dahan&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mirage\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fear&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gather Invaders&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Haboob/Sandstorm\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Destroy Explorers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Destroy Towns&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fear&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Push Explorers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Push Towns&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Defend&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Skip Actions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Desert Heat\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Deal damage with extra in Sands&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cactus\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wilds tokens&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Defend&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Desert Varnish\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Defend&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Flash Floods\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ultimately decided against trying to describe this one since River had a Flash Flood card already.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Quicksand\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Defend&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wilds&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Beasts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Destroy Explorers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fear&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Singing Sand Dunes (Look it up, it\u2019s pretty cool)\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gather Explorers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fear&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did realize at a later date that Quicksand isn\u2019t actually a desert thing (as portrayed in movies) since its composition requires a decent amount of water, which isn\u2019t something that deserts are particularly rife with. Hindsight is 20/20, so I decided to go with it at the beginning since it seemed so versatile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m a Computer Scientist by trade and I find that naming things is incredibly difficult sometimes. As such, I waffled all over the place trying to come up with a name for this Spirit. I really wanted it to have a name like Shifting Sands Consume the Lost, or Shifting Sands Devours the Doomed, but the alliterations were killing me. I threw around other weird names like Shifting Sand\u2019s Black Blizzard, or even Desert As An All Consuming Void (blech). It was really hard. Then I finally settled on &lt;strong&gt;Shifting Desert\u2019s Gaping Maw&lt;/strong&gt;. It just felt right saying it and reading it on paper, so that\u2019s what I went with. The name has grown on me since then and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll change it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now with a name and some basic ideas of thematic elements I could use to bring the Spirit to life, I moved on to the next step, creating the first (very rough) draft.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Initial Ideas Chosen for Unique Power Cards:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bottomless Pits of Quicksand\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;3 Cost, Fast, Range 1 from Sand, Any land&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Defend 4&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Destroy 1 Explorer&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Add 1 Wilds&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Elements: Water/Earth (Water = Sun)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Scorch with Desert Heat\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2 Cost, Slow, Range 1 from Sand, Any land&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1 Damage&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;+1 Damage if target land is Sand&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Elements: Sun/Fire/Air&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Singing Dunes of Sand\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2 Cost, Slow, Range 1 from Sand, Any land&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2 Fear&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gather up to 2 Explorers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Elements: Earth/Sun&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thrashing Walls of Sand\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2 Cost, Slow, Range 1 from Sand, Any land&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Destroy 1 Explorer and 1 Town&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Elements: Air/Sun&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Anyone who plays the game regularly will most likely find some things wrong with the above Power Cards just with a cursory glance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, all names are WIP and most of them aren&amp;#39;t even what I&amp;#39;m using now, it just goes to show how dynamic and changing the process was for me at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This article will be limited to the draft of the Power Cards and some links on how to get your own templates to use for your own purposes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the &lt;a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/180640/power-card-front-template-file\"&gt;Power Card Template&lt;/a&gt; that I used as well as the &lt;a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/180025/spirit-panel-play-side-template-file\"&gt;Spirit Panel Template&lt;/a&gt;. A huge shout out to BGG user Latzko and his amazing work in making these templates (as well as the others users that have contributed to the process).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note: The files are in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic) format, so open it with whatever preferred software you have for it (Photoshop or something else). I downloaded Inkscape (and it&amp;#39;s what was recommended in Latzko&amp;#39;s post) and it has been a useful tool if you&amp;#39;re not opposed to free open source applications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Power Card Template is pretty straightforward, you just need to download it and you&amp;#39;re good to start using it after unzipping it from the archive. Just open it in Inkscape (or other program) and you can start working on it. A note, you will want to install the fonts that come in the zip archive to get what seems to be the closest font to what is officially used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Spirit Panel Template&amp;#39;s directions aren&amp;#39;t quite as obvious. I&amp;#39;ll list out what each file is for and the format:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Part 1 - Zip Archive that contains the SVG file, a README to help with explaining, and 4 font archives.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Part 2 - It&amp;#39;s a 002 Format, which isn&amp;#39;t anything your computer will recognize. Just put it in the same place as the SVG file from Part 1&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Part 3 - It&amp;#39;s a 003 Format, so do the same thing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Part 4 - It&amp;#39;s a 004 Format, so do the same thing once more.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that, with everything in the same folder, you&amp;#39;re good to just open the SVG file in Inkscape and go from there. Latzko has provided a wonderful tutorial on the different aspects on the template and how to use it if you have questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So with that, I had made the (very) rough draft of the starting Unique Power Cards. In the next article I&amp;#39;ll walk you through the process of creating the Spirit Board, including Growth option, Presence Tracks, Elemental thresholds, Innate Powers, and the reasoning behind all of it. Depending on how long that article is, I may even go into the first play-testing session where I learned that I new very little about balance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until then, see you all next time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": ":spirit_island: Heart of the Wildfire", "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "c64wqe", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LordMotas", "num_crossposts": 1, "num_comments": 7, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/boardgames/comments/c64wqe/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_2_creating_the_thematic/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c64wqe/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_2_creating_the_thematic/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2056539, "created_utc": 1561638449.0, "discussion_type": null, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "boardgames", "selftext": "Hello everyone,\nMany games come with cardboard inserts in the boxes.
