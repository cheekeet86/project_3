I invited several friends to go relax, retreat, and game, but most of the time it was my best buddy and me. We created a gaming Olympiad, a heptathalon (if that's a word), and I'm going to tell you all about it! If you wanna read only about certain events, you can skip forward to:\n\n1: pixel tactics\n\n2: mtg power cubes\n\n3: deck builders\n\n4: EPIC\n\n5: battlecon\n\n6: Carl Chudyk\n\n7: Food Chain Magnate \n\n&amp;&amp;&amp;\n\nThe Olympiad consisted of 7 events, or pillars. First to win 4 takes it down. We jumped around from pillar to pillar each day to prevent burn out on one game.\n\n&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\n\nPillar 1: pixel tactics constructed. Create 3 decks from all the sets. Play each deck versus each opposing deck twice each (18 games) plus one game with the deck of your choice. Best 10/19 games takes the pillar. This pillar took an incredible amount of prep. We had to sort through about 15 cards and pick 3 leaders to build around. That took days of analysis paralysis. Ultimately, the leaders I picked hard countered a couple of his. Like, he had Byron (all your dudes have two life but only ever take one damage) and I had Lixis (1 damage to all opposing dudes every wave). He had Adjenna (opponents can't use clear corpse action) and I had Luca (you can redraw top card of discard pile if you use it right away, ie spam revive corpse orders). After about 8 matches and having seen each of our leaders, he scooped the pillar to me to save time. And no, there was no coming back, his scoop was not premature.\n\n&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\n\nPillar 2: MtG Power Cubes. I have two vintage powered cubes. One that is more combo oriented and balanced, and one that has almost no combo and is more interactive. So we started with the combo cube. We pack drafted two decks simultaneously, having to allocate each drafted card to deck A or B. Then each deck played each opposing deck in a best 3/5 match. That's 4 matches so far. Then we used the other cube and simultaneously drafted 3 decks and played each against each other in a 3/5 (9 more matches). Best 7/13 matches takes the pillar. \n\nSo in the first cube, I dominated. Drafted a show n tell style deck and a mono green crater hoof natural order deck. He drafted a reanimator deck and a mono white control/Armageddon/winter orb/stax deck. Both mine beat both of his and I took a 4-0 match advantage. Then on the other cube, I drafted mono red aggro, mono white midrange, and UB control. He drafted esper control, jund midrange, and WG aggro. He stormed back! My red deck lost two matches them barely beat wg on a mana screw. Then my W deck went 0-3. So now the match score is 5-5!!! First to 7 takes the pillar. Then my UB beats jund, barely, with game 5 ending in such a grind that he decks out. 6-5. Then my UB beats wg and takes down the pillar! Extremely nerve wracking. I thought he was gonna crack my 4-0 lead!!!\n\n&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\n\nPillar 3: deck building. So we were really limited on games due to suitcase space. So in this pillar, we would play Star Realms, Tanto Cuore, and Flip City, each best 3/5. Whoever wins two of those three takes the pillar. We start with star realms. I win two in a row then he wins 3. Then we play flip city and he sweeps me. Takes down the pillar in under 2 hours!!\n\n&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\n\nPillar 4: EPIC. So for those not familiar, this game is kinda mtg: lite. So we each have 3 sets of cards. We started by open drafting a deck and playing 3/5, which I took down. Then we constructed 2 decks each and played 4 matches best 3/5 each. We split those. I took down the pillar best 3 of 5 matches (each 3/5 games). Interestingly, one pair of decks we each built was quite similar, a red yellow control deck with lots of removal and recursion.\n\n&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\n\nPillar 5: battlecon. So we each drafted 20 fighters and split them into 5 teams of 4. We use each team once, best 3/5 matches (one team versus another team for a match). The format was this: simultaneously ban an opposing fighter. Then play best of 3. Game 1 you simultaneously pick an opposing fighter they can't use in game 1. Game two features an arena effect. Best 2/3 takes the match. \n\nMatch 1: the game 2 arena says that each beat, you gain a life if you didn't hit the opposing fighter. I ban Madelina (scary) and he bans Seth. Game 1: my Prince Elien loses to Clinhyde as I'm unable to ever benefit from my wall protection. Game 2 is my Tatsumi versus his Runika. We dance around forever. I'm trying to gradually pick off his artifacts before engaging. Late, I end up making a blunder on a beat where he couldn't even reach me by waking forward directly into his fist and giving the game away. He's up 1 match to none.\n\nMatch 2. The game 2 arena gradually fills the board up with candles on your space, end of beat, or damages you if you're on one. When board is full of candles, you can then ante candles you're on to gain various effects, including ignore stun guard. He bans aria, I ban shekhtur. \n\nGame 1: my burgundy loses to his lymn. Lymn constantly causes prio mix ups and I was repeatedly wrong. Game 2 my Karin plays way too predictably and loses to his main, zaamassal. He takes match 2 and now I'm totally in my own head, feeling like he can read me at every decision.\n\nMatch 3: the game 2 arena says you can fall off the edge of the board and take 4 damage. I ban Wardlaw, his 3-4th main. He bans khadath. By the way, each of these battlecon matches was a different day, allowing the loser top rest and recoup. I reached the conclusion that I had been playing on yomi level zero (ie just playing what I thought were good attack pairs) and he was anticipating those. I went back to my old method of analyzing what his most likely pairs were. Game 1 my lucida crushes his merjoram. Both characters want to stand still and trade. Mine just does it better. He also didn't have his full concentration that day, hard reading me on several beats and just being bad at math and punting. Game 2 my Jin beats his Sarafina. Sara is one of my mains, which he hate drafted not really knowing how to use her. I hard read him a couple times, and my movement and hit confirm nullified his mix ups. I win the set 2-0 and trail 1 match to 2.\n\nMatch 4: the game 2 arena says each beat has a 50% chance of recycling backwards. I ban Hepzibah (our consensus #1 pick agreed) he bans Kajia. Game 1 my rukyuk beats his iaxus. Neither of us plays these characters much, but I get there. Game 2 i got what I thought was a good match up, my malandrax versus his kehrolyn, but I actually had trouble keeping her off me and he got there. 1-1. Game 3 my clive versus his cadenza. He remarks that this is a great matchup for him since he can stun me off my modules. I stay silent. Basically I take one big hit and then keep him at bay the rest of the game. He even lands a grapnel but I foresee this and use the thing that negates his on hit effects, so he can't pull me. I take it down easily. 2-2 in matches. Fortunately I have my strongest team last. \n\nMatch 5: game 2 arena says the lower health player can move a barrier marker and nobody can end their movement on it. I ban Adjenna, his second main, he bans Thessala, my #1 pick. \nGame 1 my Cherri squeaks out a win against cesar. Game 2 in the arena is my lesandra versus his lixis. I request we play game 3 first since i have a great matchup, which we do. My baenvier crushes his orianna. I wait till he commits a lot of magic points to an attack them simply negate our styles, rendering his character practically useless. I win the final match and thus the pillar (making a huge comeback) and thus the entire Olympiad.\n\n&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\n\nPillar 6: chudyk. Best 4/7 mottainai, best 2/3 impulse, best 2/3 GTR. Whoever wins two of those takes it. He wins mottainai 4-3 but we don't end up completing the pillar because I won battlecon that afternoon and ended it. \n\n&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\n\nPillar 7: beat 2/3 food chain magnate. Didn't start this one.\n\nWell hope you enjoyed reading this. We had a great time playing the most epic gaming marathon ever.

Create 3 decks from all the sets. Play each deck versus each opposing deck twice each (18 games) plus one game with the deck of your choice. Best 10/19 games takes the pillar. This pillar took an incredible amount of prep. We had to sort through about 15 cards and pick 3 leaders to build around. That took days of analysis paralysis. Ultimately, the leaders I picked hard countered a couple of his. Like, he had Byron (all your dudes have two life but only ever take one damage) and I had Lixis (1 damage to all opposing dudes every wave). He had Adjenna (opponents can&amp;#39;t use clear corpse action) and I had Luca (you can redraw top card of discard pile if you use it right away, ie spam revive corpse orders). After about 8 matches and having seen each of our leaders, he scooped the pillar to me to save time. And no, there was no coming back, his scoop was not premature.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pillar 2: MtG Power Cubes. I have two vintage powered cubes. One that is more combo oriented and balanced, and one that has almost no combo and is more interactive. So we started with the combo cube. We pack drafted two decks simultaneously, having to allocate each drafted card to deck A or B. Then each deck played each opposing deck in a best 3/5 match. That&amp;#39;s 4 matches so far. Then we used the other cube and simultaneously drafted 3 decks and played each against each other in a 3/5 (9 more matches). Best 7/13 matches takes the pillar. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in the first cube, I dominated. Drafted a show n tell style deck and a mono green crater hoof natural order deck. He drafted a reanimator deck and a mono white control/Armageddon/winter orb/stax deck. Both mine beat both of his and I took a 4-0 match advantage. Then on the other cube, I drafted mono red aggro, mono white midrange, and UB control. He drafted esper control, jund midrange, and WG aggro. He stormed back! My red deck lost two matches them barely beat wg on a mana screw. Then my W deck went 0-3. So now the match score is 5-5!!! First to 7 takes the pillar. Then my UB beats jund, barely, with game 5 ending in such a grind that he decks out. 6-5. Then my UB beats wg and takes down the pillar! Extremely nerve wracking. I thought he was gonna crack my 4-0 lead!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pillar 3: deck building. So we were really limited on games due to suitcase space. So in this pillar, we would play Star Realms, Tanto Cuore, and Flip City, each best 3/5. Whoever wins two of those three takes the pillar. We start with star realms. I win two in a row then he wins 3. Then we play flip city and he sweeps me. Takes down the pillar in under 2 hours!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pillar 4: EPIC. So for those not familiar, this game is kinda mtg: lite. So we each have 3 sets of cards. We started by open drafting a deck and playing 3/5, which I took down. Then we constructed 2 decks each and played 4 matches best 3/5 each. We split those. I took down the pillar best 3 of 5 matches (each 3/5 games). Interestingly, one pair of decks we each built was quite similar, a red yellow control deck with lots of removal and recursion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pillar 5: battlecon. So we each drafted 20 fighters and split them into 5 teams of 4. We use each team once, best 3/5 matches (one team versus another team for a match). The format was this: simultaneously ban an opposing fighter. Then play best of 3. Game 1 you simultaneously pick an opposing fighter they can&amp;#39;t use in game 1. Game two features an arena effect. Best 2/3 takes the match. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Match 1: the game 2 arena says that each beat, you gain a life if you didn&amp;#39;t hit the opposing fighter. I ban Madelina (scary) and he bans Seth. Game 1: my Prince Elien loses to Clinhyde as I&amp;#39;m unable to ever benefit from my wall protection. Game 2 is my Tatsumi versus his Runika. We dance around forever. I&amp;#39;m trying to gradually pick off his artifacts before engaging. Late, I end up making a blunder on a beat where he couldn&amp;#39;t even reach me by waking forward directly into his fist and giving the game away. He&amp;#39;s up 1 match to none.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Match 2. The game 2 arena gradually fills the board up with candles on your space, end of beat, or damages you if you&amp;#39;re on one. When board is full of candles, you can then ante candles you&amp;#39;re on to gain various effects, including ignore stun guard. He bans aria, I ban shekhtur. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Game 1: my burgundy loses to his lymn. Lymn constantly causes prio mix ups and I was repeatedly wrong. Game 2 my Karin plays way too predictably and loses to his main, zaamassal. He takes match 2 and now I&amp;#39;m totally in my own head, feeling like he can read me at every decision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Match 3: the game 2 arena says you can fall off the edge of the board and take 4 damage. I ban Wardlaw, his 3-4th main. He bans khadath. By the way, each of these battlecon matches was a different day, allowing the loser top rest and recoup. I reached the conclusion that I had been playing on yomi level zero (ie just playing what I thought were good attack pairs) and he was anticipating those. I went back to my old method of analyzing what his most likely pairs were. Game 1 my lucida crushes his merjoram. Both characters want to stand still and trade. Mine just does it better. He also didn&amp;#39;t have his full concentration that day, hard reading me on several beats and just being bad at math and punting. Game 2 my Jin beats his Sarafina. Sara is one of my mains, which he hate drafted not really knowing how to use her. I hard read him a couple times, and my movement and hit confirm nullified his mix ups. I win the set 2-0 and trail 1 match to 2.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Match 4: the game 2 arena says each beat has a 50% chance of recycling backwards. I ban Hepzibah (our consensus #1 pick agreed) he bans Kajia. Game 1 my rukyuk beats his iaxus. Neither of us plays these characters much, but I get there. Game 2 i got what I thought was a good match up, my malandrax versus his kehrolyn, but I actually had trouble keeping her off me and he got there. 1-1. Game 3 my clive versus his cadenza. He remarks that this is a great matchup for him since he can stun me off my modules. I stay silent. Basically I take one big hit and then keep him at bay the rest of the game. He even lands a grapnel but I foresee this and use the thing that negates his on hit effects, so he can&amp;#39;t pull me. I take it down easily. 2-2 in matches. Fortunately I have my strongest team last. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Match 5: game 2 arena says the lower health player can move a barrier marker and nobody can end their movement on it. I ban Adjenna, his second main, he bans Thessala, my #1 pick. \nGame 1 my Cherri squeaks out a win against cesar. Game 2 in the arena is my lesandra versus his lixis. I request we play game 3 first since i have a great matchup, which we do. My baenvier crushes his orianna. I wait till he commits a lot of magic points to an attack them simply negate our styles, rendering his character practically useless. I win the final match and thus the pillar (making a huge comeback) and thus the entire Olympiad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pillar 6: chudyk. Best 4/7 mottainai, best 2/3 impulse, best 2/3 GTR. Whoever wins two of those takes it. He wins mottainai 4-3 but we don&amp;#39;t end up completing the pillar because I won battlecon that afternoon and ended it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pillar 7: beat 2/3 food chain magnate. Didn&amp;#39;t start this one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well hope you enjoyed reading this. We had a great time playing the most epic gaming marathon ever.
