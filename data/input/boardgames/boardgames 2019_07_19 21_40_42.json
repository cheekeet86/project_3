This is apparently called warp.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But so that I don&amp;#39;t have the warp color on the outside, I left myself a 3mm edge, which is in the outside color.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1I3UWG9JoV3SWbF8gBHyB9-KaD1v1tlC6\"&gt;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1I3UWG9JoV3SWbF8gBHyB9-KaD1v1tlC6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Day 13&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today was a really exhausting day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Usually I have an 8 hour day earning money.But today was my day off and I found time to fully concentrate on the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Karsten from Stimulus-Games spend a lot of time with me (Karsten is the creator of Movie Empire).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wow - the logo has improved by another 600% (thanks to Karsten) and I really managed to do a lot fo things with the box design.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1B0e_QXXMsLd_Mg4LHSmYUYthD7eTFTvH\"&gt;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1B0e_QXXMsLd_Mg4LHSmYUYthD7eTFTvH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I bought my barcode today (5 pieces for 10 Euro - needed later for Amazon, Ebay...) and already inserted it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Day 14&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not so much happened today. I printed a MiniBox and put it together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Building it I wanted to check whether everything is on the real 3D object as I imagined it to be.Unfortunately, I noticed that I put the backside upside down and a design element on the wrong side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I rearranged everything and now it looks good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next I updated the offer.Since I printed out all game pieces with the 3D printer and partly provided them with the right color, 3 dimensions have changed. E.g., the paths become a bit thicker, but not as thick as the locations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I would like more velvet bags so that everything in the box keeps its place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I now have good graphics for almost everything, I attached them directly to the mail to the producer.I have attached the Mini Box for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lcGuj4BQ9aR0QJ-iaD-gLctXFZQcNsmw\"&gt;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lcGuj4BQ9aR0QJ-iaD-gLctXFZQcNsmw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope to see you at my next entry again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Previous posts:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c9l5wd/developer_diary_for_werewolf_vs_vampire/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c9l5wd/developer_diary_for_werewolf_vs_vampire/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/cbeoyw/developer_diary_for_werewolf_vs_vampire_1/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/cbeoyw/developer_diary_for_werewolf_vs_vampire_1/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/cdnf9g/developer_diary_for_werewolf_vs_vampire_2/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/cdnf9g/developer_diary_for_werewolf_vs_vampire_2/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/c0MpkkqE1lJymVbCZmZhlXYf9Yt-ofL3ZcYyyDrnemM.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=557809fed049bcd94a0bf9401ba1d010e0c70dac", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/c0MpkkqE1lJymVbCZmZhlXYf9Yt-ofL3ZcYyyDrnemM.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2307ad49ca999d155aa8a3b774e8f173001b515c", "width": 108, "height": 56}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/c0MpkkqE1lJymVbCZmZhlXYf9Yt-ofL3ZcYyyDrnemM.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e66bfde0fd6fb2fc5d7035822379180f5f92d9c6", "width": 216, "height": 113}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/c0MpkkqE1lJymVbCZmZhlXYf9Yt-ofL3ZcYyyDrnemM.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fa88a6e435319ee03b57be31db6eed134bec531", "width": 320, "height": 168}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/c0MpkkqE1lJymVbCZmZhlXYf9Yt-ofL3ZcYyyDrnemM.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=283d70a11bcc4f31221e8f7e3a488cadc7a0dbaa", "width": 640, "height": 336}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/c0MpkkqE1lJymVbCZmZhlXYf9Yt-ofL3ZcYyyDrnemM.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d5c91d364d86bffbfe3c35d9146340e1d795baf", "width": 960, "height": 504}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/c0MpkkqE1lJymVbCZmZhlXYf9Yt-ofL3ZcYyyDrnemM.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39e4a3a58d5e80db9247ebc3c57d880d694925b6", "width": 1080, "height": 567}], "variants": {}, "id": "mQz9Egt6d1aFLNbElmJnzx2BdjaVTgQMpMCP70UQ5HA"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "00a3aaec-7138-11e7-82b7-0e38c8f4bbce", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "cewlbw", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MrCasualGame", "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/boardgames/comments/cewlbw/developer_diary_for_werewolf_vs_vampire_3/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/cewlbw/developer_diary_for_werewolf_vs_vampire_3/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2056538, "created_utc": 1563476063.0, "discussion_type": null, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "boardgames", "selftext": "I've played 7W just a few times, but I'm a little bit unclear as to how 7W should be won, outside of what seems like, whoever grabs the most Blue cards in the 3rd Age tends to win.

What makes it complex are the factions.  Not only do you have to understand what your faction needs to do to win, you also need to understand what to do to prevent the other factions from winning. \n\nFor new players, this is simply too much to consider for the first few games. They tend to look entirely inward and are largely unaware of the actual state of the game in terms of which faction is the most likely to win at any given time.  I think this can be off-putting to some people.  To help alleviate this issue, I wrote a basic guide on How to Play and How to Beat each faction, and am considering printing it out and giving it to each player.  Of course I'll explain the mechanical rules as well, but this will simply be used as a reference so they have a better understanding of the game state at any given time.  I want advice as to whether or not this a good idea.  Would this ruin the experience or negatively effect some factions more than others?\n\nI'll attach the guide (info and opinions are taken from my plays and from guides and recaps I've read) as a goole doc link here.

Not only do you have to understand what your faction needs to do to win, you also need to understand what to do to prevent the other factions from winning. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For new players, this is simply too much to consider for the first few games. They tend to look entirely inward and are largely unaware of the actual state of the game in terms of which faction is the most likely to win at any given time.  I think this can be off-putting to some people.  To help alleviate this issue, I wrote a basic guide on How to Play and How to Beat each faction, and am considering printing it out and giving it to each player.  Of course I&amp;#39;ll explain the mechanical rules as well, but this will simply be used as a reference so they have a better understanding of the game state at any given time.
