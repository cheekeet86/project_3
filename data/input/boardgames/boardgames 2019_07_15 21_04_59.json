Our group's particular way of playing is that four of us sit down and play while our artist friend draws what happens. We also decided to theme our settlement (and its inhabitants) after Saturday morning cartoons. Here's what followed:\n\nWe elected to play a campaign called \"People of the Sun\", in which a small group of humans find a horrible monster in the middle of spawning its young and decide to worship it. [Dilbert, Daria, Doctor Zoidberg, and Wilma Flintstone all took a turn drinking the water from the monster's spawning pool](https://i.imgur.com/JKteIf4.jpg), while the horrible beast observed from above.\n\nThe survivors then set out to start hunting monster prey, to collect resources and build their settlement. [Daria was the first to go, when her head was exploded by a White Lion.](https://i.imgur.com/USMeWQm.jpg)\n\n[Doctor Zoidberg fell next](https://i.imgur.com/hGqhYWT.jpg), clawed to death by another White Lion.\n\nScreams erupted from the darkness, and the survivors determined that it must be the call of a new monster: the Screaming Antelope. On the hunt to find this elusive monster, [Dilbert fell off a cliff, broke his leg, and wet himself.](https://i.imgur.com/jEK2ji7.jpg) He laid there for a long time, contemplating the futility of his existence.\n\nThe fight with the Screaming Antelope went better than the White Lion hunts, although Wilma Flintstone did fall in battle. [When the horrible beast opened it's screaming undermaw towards her she experienced a mental break and died of abject terror.](https://i.imgur.com/wtSrn3g.jpg)\n\nThings started to turn around with the birth of our first Child of the Sun.  Proud parents [Tina Belcher and Morty proudly display their newborn daughter, Sailor Moon.](https://i.imgur.com/rWYoW0E.jpg) She will be our settlement's saviour.\n\nWith our new saviour online we made easy work of [increasingly higher level Screaming Antelopes](https://i.imgur.com/lT0pW8B.jpg). Even the horrible Pheonix fell to our survivors, although the first one we fought [did take down Goliath](https://i.imgur.com/57r6xzX.jpg), leader of the Gargoyles.\n\nOne of our settlement's biggest setbacks was the raucous party that we threw for some reason, in which we [destroyed every resource in the settlement](https://i.imgur.com/1nPKkz3.jpg). Seen here: Morty destroying resources, Sailor Moon and Waldo fucking in public, Dilbert throwing useful monster bits into the fire, and CatDog looking on sadly.\n\nWe continued to have our fair share of tough hunts. Such as the time when everyone decided to go fishing around in a river of blood and faeces to try and catch the monster's trail. [Morty did manage to find some interesting monster bits, but Sailor Moon, Babar, and Nigel Thornberry just spent the whole time puking](https://i.imgur.com/hQsepLe.jpg). A nightmare whale swam overhead, as the Pheonix eluded us.\n\nFinally, we reached the campaign endgame, which involves fighting an increasingly powerful gauntlet of villains in a row before taking on the final boss. The Kingsman fight went very smoothly. It went SO well that [Patrick the starfish decided to take a break from the battle to root around in a nearby monster corpse for extra resources](https://i.imgur.com/LbREnrp.jpg). Inside he found a Dung Beetle Knight eyeball, which he quickly consumed for +30 insanity. Nigel Thornberry, Yogi Bear, and DW fought on without him.\n\nWe weren't so fortunate in our battle with the Butcher. Throughout the course of the fight the Butcher ripped off the faces of Love-a-lot-Bear, Bradley from Stickin' Around, and... Sailor Moon's dear father Morty! [Although Sailor Moon was able to deliver the killing blow to the Butcher by herself, the grief of losing her father was too great](https://i.imgur.com/ruVsYpR.jpg). She carved off her own face in the aftermath, fashioning it into a Forsaker's Mask.\n\nAll that's left to us now is the fight with The Hand of the King, and then the Great Devourer himself!", "author_fullname": "t2_16n2ak", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 1, "clicked": false, "title": "Kingdom Sketch - in which our buddy draws our Kingdom Death Campaign", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_c4va7v", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 163, "total_awards_received": 1, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 163, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1561412348.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_2": 1}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1561437599.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.boardgames", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those that don&amp;#39;t know, &lt;a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/55690/kingdom-death-monster\"&gt;Kingdom Death&lt;/a&gt; is a game that involves a huge amount of story creation.

What size do you need? What Shelf? Don\u2019t forget to get the brace thingy for the back of the shelf! They don\u2019t even really display it much at IKEA \u2013 I had to ask the salesperson where the display was (hidden in the back) so I could see it before I bought it.\n\n\u00b7 I guess it could tip over if you have small children who want to climb up the shelves \u2013 or you have to drill it into the wall to keep this from happening (perhaps you do this with KALLAX as well?)\n\n\u00b7 ?? other?

Here are my thoughts.\n\n**TL/DR**: If you like Pandemic and Kane Klenko, buy this game. Fun, fast, stressful dice-chucker.\n\n**Summary**: In Pandemic: Rapid Response you are flying around the world on a giant disaster response airplane, bringing necessary supplies to locations in need. To do this, you are rolling dice to move your pawn, create supplies, fly the airplane, and drop supplies off to the people in need. But don't stop and think - this is real time, and if you aren't fast enough, you lose.\n\n**Components**: This is a top-notch production. The board, cards, and components are great, but the dice ... oh, the dice are spectacular. You spend the majority of the game rolling and placing dice, so the fact that they are beautiful, solid, easy to see objects makes the game that much better. I can't think of better dice in a game.\n\n**Set-up**: Getting the game ready to play is quick and painless. Everybody grabs their dice, pawn, and role card. Shuffle up a couple of small decks and distribute the cards as explained in the rule book. Put out some cubes and the timer. You're playing the game just a couple of minutes after opening the box.\n\n**Game Play**: In P:RR you flip over the sand timer, and then take turns rolling and placing dice. It's the classic Yahtzee style, where you can re-roll up to 2 times. Each die can be used in multiple ways - move your pawn, assign to supply areas, move the plane, eliminate waste. While you want to maximize your dice usage, it can be just as useful to ignore some of your dice and pass to the next player. The only requirement in your turn is that you roll the dice you have once.\n\nWhen the sand timer runs out you pause, add a new city to your list of trouble spots, and remove a time token. You start with 3 time tokens, and gain new ones when you successfully deliver supplies to a city. When you've mastered the flow of the game, you can add in Crisis cards. You flip over one Crisis card every time the timer runs out - these cards will randomly cause issues that need to be addressed.\n\nIf you get the appropriate supplies to all the cities before you run out of time tokens, you win. If you run out of time tokens, or if you generate too much waste, you lose.\n\n**Difficulty Scaling**: There are four difficulty levels in the rule book, and I've played the first 3. Easy is just to learn the mechanics. If you have any experience with games you shouldn't lose. We only lost once on Normal, and haven't beaten Hard. You can then choose to add in Crisis cards, which makes whatever level you are playing at harder. You should be able to adjust the difficulty to be exactly as hard as you want.\n\n**Player Count**: I've played this game at 2, 3 and 4 players, and it scales perfectly well. There are some slight strategy differences at 2P. For example, if you \"lock up\" your dice, the odds that another player will come by and finish that supply room are lower. There were a couple times at 2P where my wife and I were rapidly taking turns rolling 2 dice until we got that one icon to create supplies. In 4P that never happened. At the 4P count, it was easier for the players who were waiting for their turn to analyze the board and guide the other players. At 2P, there was a lot more \"Wait, what are we doing now?\" moments. Interestingly, there are absolutely no setup differences at the various player counts, and the game works great at all of them.\n\n**Game Length**: Here is one example of the box telling the truth. Games take about 20 minutes - less if you flame out early. Because it's real-time, there's really no way for the game to take longer than advertised.\n\n**General Thoughts**: This game is exactly what you would expect from a Pandemic/Kane Klenko mash-up. It has the real-time trappings that Klenko puts into games like FUSE and Flatline, with the Pandemic aesthetic. I expect this game will stay in my collection for a long time. You can take it out and be playing in less than 5 minutes, and games last 20 minutes or less. Any new gamer can pick up on it quickly, and you can scale the difficulty as much or as little as you want. My wife loves Pandemic and co-ops, and FUSE and Flatline are two of her favorite games - so this one just rocketed right up to the top of her list. The fact that you have to make decisions in a 20 minute co-op is cool. Do you wait to get one more die to help fill supplies later on, or grab what you need this second and run? Do we go for the hard city first or leave it to the end?\n\nI've already played hundreds of games in the Pandemic franchise or Kane Klenko design school, so this one was a no-brainer for me. I play-tested it a year and a half ago, and knew I would buy it the first chance I had.

You start with 3 time tokens, and gain new ones when you successfully deliver supplies to a city. When you&amp;#39;ve mastered the flow of the game, you can add in Crisis cards. You flip over one Crisis card every time the timer runs out - these cards will randomly cause issues that need to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you get the appropriate supplies to all the cities before you run out of time tokens, you win. If you run out of time tokens, or if you generate too much waste, you lose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulty Scaling&lt;/strong&gt;: There are four difficulty levels in the rule book, and I&amp;#39;ve played the first 3. Easy is just to learn the mechanics. If you have any experience with games you shouldn&amp;#39;t lose. We only lost once on Normal, and haven&amp;#39;t beaten Hard. You can then choose to add in Crisis cards, which makes whatever level you are playing at harder. You should be able to adjust the difficulty to be exactly as hard as you want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Player Count&lt;/strong&gt;: I&amp;#39;ve played this game at 2, 3 and 4 players, and it scales perfectly well. There are some slight strategy differences at 2P. For example, if you &amp;quot;lock up&amp;quot; your dice, the odds that another player will come by and finish that supply room are lower. There were a couple times at 2P where my wife and I were rapidly taking turns rolling 2 dice until we got that one icon to create supplies. In 4P that never happened. At the 4P count, it was easier for the players who were waiting for their turn to analyze the board and guide the other players. At 2P, there was a lot more &amp;quot;Wait, what are we doing now?&amp;quot; moments. Interestingly, there are absolutely no setup differences at the various player counts, and the game works great at all of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game Length&lt;/strong&gt;: Here is one example of the box telling the truth. Games take about 20 minutes - less if you flame out early. Because it&amp;#39;s real-time, there&amp;#39;s really no way for the game to take longer than advertised.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;: This game is exactly what you would expect from a Pandemic/Kane Klenko mash-up. It has the real-time trappings that Klenko puts into games like FUSE and Flatline, with the Pandemic aesthetic. I expect this game will stay in my collection for a long time. You can take it out and be playing in less than 5 minutes, and games last 20 minutes or less. Any new gamer can pick up on it quickly, and you can scale the difficulty as much or as little as you want. My wife loves Pandemic and co-ops, and FUSE and Flatline are two of her favorite games - so this one just rocketed right up to the top of her list. The fact that you have to make decisions in a 20 minute co-op is cool. Do you wait to get one more die to help fill supplies later on, or grab what you need this second and run? Do we go for the hard city first or leave it to the end?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve already played hundreds of games in the Pandemic franchise or Kane Klenko design school, so this one was a no-brainer for me. I play-tested it a year and a half ago, and knew I would buy it the first chance I had. This is one of those great times where the game lived up to expectations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": "Aeon's End", "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "c4sexa", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "IWasTheFirstKlund", "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 22, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/boardgames/comments/c4sexa/pandemic_rapid_response_review_after_10_plays/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c4sexa/pandemic_rapid_response_review_after_10_plays/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2047801, "created_utc": 1561398954.0, "discussion_type": null, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "boardgames", "selftext": "Ordered back in Feb. for a supposed June arrival.

We\u2019ve played it countless times since then and it doesn\u2019t show any signs of stopping. I backed Jagged Earth and await its arrival with bated breath.\n\nUnlike blogs that don\u2019t give you the recipe at the beginning, I\u2019ll keep the story short so you don\u2019t have to scroll any further to see what you came here to see.\n\nI have been researching and playing around with creating a new Spirit for Spirit Island for the past two months or so and I thought it might be interesting to post my findings and discoveries somewhere where they might be appreciated and/or used by others in the future. I\u2019ll be breaking this up into a few parts to show the design process that I went through.\n\nTo start off, I needed an idea. A concept for a Spirit that I wanted in the game. There weren't any real desert-based Spirits, just a bunch that start in the Sands. So I started there.\n\nMy original concept was to base a Spirit off of the idea of an antlion. An antlion is a creature that burrows into the sand and creates a trap for unsuspecting prey. A Spirit that would feel like an antlion would perform similar functions, gathering and devouring.\n\nNow that I had an idea, I was ready to begin my research.\n\n**The Research**\n\nI started off with what made the most sense to me. I began analyzing every aspect of a Spirit I could think of. I tried to ask as many questions as I could. This would allow me to answer important future questions about my Spirit's play style and features in terms of what I already understood. I also want a database of numbers from which to draw from later.\n\n**Unique Power Cards:**\n\n* What is the distribution of Energy costs?\n* What is the ratio of Slow vs Fast?\n* How much could be done for the respective amounts of Energy spent?\n* When combined with Slow or Fast, how much could be done with the Energy spent?\n* Are Unique Power Cards more powerful than regular Minor Powers?\n\n**Presence Tracks:**\n\n* What were the minimum and maximum amounts of Energy generated among the Spirits?\n* What is the average amount of Energy generated among the Spirits after removing outliers?\n* What are the minimum and maximum number of Card Plays among the Spirits?\n* Is there a correlation between complexity and Elemental symbols on Presence Tracks?\n\n**Innate Powers:**\n\n* How were the Elemental thresholds designed for the Innate Powers?\n* How many thresholds are there for each Power?\n* How hard is each threshold to obtain respective of each Spirit?\n\n**Play Styles:**\n\n* How many different kinds of overarching play styles were there?\n* What were the attributes of said play styles?\n\n**Growth Options:**\n\n* How many growth options does each Spirit have?\n* What is paired with the Reclaim All Growth option?\n* How are Growth options different for Spirits that can pick two instead of one?\n* What are general trends seen in Growth options?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith all of these questions in mind. I set out to learn as much as I could about the content that already exists (not including Jagged Earth since all we have is PnP stuff that's still being developed).\n\nNow for the part you are waiting for, the results:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Unique Power Cards:**\n\n* The average cost is 1.167. Most Unique Power Cards cost between 0-3.\n   * EDIT: Average cost is 1.167 instead of 2, I was definitely taking the wrong number ina  calculation. Most Power cards actually have values from 0-2. Thanks to user /u/DarthWindu7 for calling me out on it.\n* The most common distributions are 2:2 or 3:1 Slow:Fast.\n* This varies greatly, but they share a common distribution with the other Minor Powers in the deck.\n* See previous answer.\n* It depends, but generally they are of a similar or slightly greater power level than the Minor Powers.\n\n**Presence Tracks:**\n\n* Minimum is 2 (Ocean) and the maximum is 12 (Serpent).\n* Removing outliers and taking into account growth options, most Spirits can generate on average 7-8 energy per turn with an empty energy track.\n* Card plays range from 3-6 with the average hovering around 4-5\n* In my research there seems to be a correlation. All of the Low Complexity Spirits lack symbols on their Presence Tracks with the exception of River, but Reclaim One isn't an element, so it gets a pass.\n\n**Innate Powers:**\n\n* It seems that the Elemental Thresholds were designed with the strongest level requiring nearly all of the Spirit's card plays or one less than that to activate. Spirits with elements in their Presence Tracks get some help with this.\n* Most Innate Powers have 3 levels, with an occasional 4 levels on some.\n* Without Elemental Symbols it requires most/all card plays to be centered on activating the Innate ability. Spirits with Elemental Symbols are usually impossible to trigger the Thresholds without their aid.\n\n**Play Styles:**\n\n* In general I found two overarching play styles. Innate based and Major Power based.\n* Innate play style is based on getting cheap cost Minor Powers with the focus on triggering all levels of the Innate Power every turn. Major Power based is pretty straightforward. Get a lot of Energy to play 1-3 Major Powers each turn.\n\n**Growth Options:**\n\n* Most Spirits have 3 Growth options, with some having 4.\n* Reclaim All is generally the weakest Growth option with the exception of Earth-based Spirits. Usually accompanied with gaining a Power Card or Energy.\n* Spirits that can choose 2 Growth options generally have an option that is simply Energy gain.\n* Most Spirits have 1 option that grants a Minor Power with some that grant 2. Placing Presence is similar. Most can place it with 1 option, while others can place it with 2 and still others can place 2 at once with a single option. Vital Strength is special and places Presence with all 3 Growth options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd there you have it. That's a brief summary of everything without nuances. I can go into further details upon request, I love talking about this stuff. It is entirely possible while putting all of this down in one place I've missed some things, so bare that in mind since there's a lot of stuff here.\n\nIf you've come across insights similar or even opposite of those presented here, I would love to hear/discuss!\n\nNext time I'll go deeper into the research of the thematic side of the Spirit: **Shifting Desert's Gaping Maw**.", "author_fullname": "t2_nqwfg", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Spirit Island Home-brew - Pt. 1 - Intro and Initial Research", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_c4mxeg", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 137, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": "2fdfa772-9cf0-11e8-922c-0e3a76b3c6b0", "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 137, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1562589468.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"a": ":spirit_island:", "e": "emoji", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/5dhccdeqncf11_t5_2qmjp/spirit_island"}, {"e": "text", "t": " Heart of the Wildfire"}], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1561408277.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "domain": "self.boardgames", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c64wqe/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_2_creating_the_thematic/\"&gt;Part 2 - Creating the Thematic Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c7s2pn/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_3_the_first_rough_draft/\"&gt;Part 3 - The First Rough Draft and Play-Test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c922pk/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_4_back_to_the_drawing/\"&gt;Part 4 - Back to the Drawing Board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/cakhsi/spirit_island_homebrew_pt_5_final_iterate_iterate/\"&gt;Part 5 (Final) - Iterate, Iterate, Iterate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To preface, I do not consider myself a board game designer in any capacity, just a hobbyist who gets a little deep into the things that he\u2019s interested in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the first of many articles I plan on posting on a semi-weekly basis until finished.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Intro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ever since playing Spirit Island back in March of 2018, my wife and I fell in love with the game.

I also played some Risk and Axis &amp; Allies in late 90s. I was introduced to Catan in early 00s and was mesmerized with it and played a few times with a bunch of my poker gaming buddies and I promptly forgot about it after I moved out of the area. I bought Catan 3 years ago and played it only 3-4 times with my wife due to lack of time and other factors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been collecting seriously only since Thanksgiving of 2018. There was a bunch of sale on boardgame apps on Android during mid last year. Bought and played a few such as TtR, Pandemic, Carcassone, etc. on my phone and was like \"I think my wife will enjoy playing more board games other than Catan\" and bought some gateway games during the holiday season sales last year. Of course, my wife ended up liking the games and I started buying a whole bunch of new games these past few months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What would you change about your collection if you could?**\n\nI would like to own some medium-heavy/heavy weight games to my list but the problem is getting it to the table. We have 2 kids and we only get to play after we put them to bed either 2 player( or 4 player games with our neighbors who also have 2 young kids). They all want to play medium weight games so that we can play lot more games that way. No regrets about buying any game in my collection as we've played almost all of them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Favorite games:**\n\nTerraforming Mars, Castles of Burgundy, Bora Bora, Caverna, The Quest for El Dorado, Five Tribes\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Favorite designers:**\n\nStefan Feld, Bruno Cathala, Uwe Rosenberg, Reiner Knizia\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Most played games:**\n\nThe Quest for El Dorado, Splendor, Jaipur, Lost Cities, TtR Europe (w/ Europa 1912 expansion), and Five Tribes probably in that order\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Newest:**\n\nConcordia Venus Standalone, Clank! (w/ Sunken Treasures expansion)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Hidden gems/Diamonds in the rough:**\n\nKana Gawa and La Isla. Both these games don't rate highly on BGG but I've found them to be fantastic filler games that can be played in 30-45 minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Not pictured:**\n\nConcordia Venus (on its way)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Shelf of Shame:**\n\nI'm yet to play The Betrayal at House on the Hill; I've only played both Pandemic and Scythe only a couple of times each so far only on solo mode. I need to get these to the table and start teaching my group.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Wanted games:**\n\nGreat Western Trail, Clans of Caledonia, Architects of West Kingdom, Brass (Lancashire or Birmingham), Troyes, Viticulture EE, Feast for Odin, Tigris and Euphrates, Spirit Island\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How did you acquire your games?**\n\nBought most of them from Amazon/Target during holiday sales or during some special promotion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome were bought used/NIS via Craigslist/FB marketplace/OfferUp.\n\n\\- I bought SmallWorld and Betryal on the Hill for $5 each via OfferUp. It was played by the seller maybe, 2-3 times each.\n\n\\- I bought Caverna via FB marketplace for $35 from someone who only took off the shrink and did not even punch out the components. The box had a minor damage in one corner but it was pristine otherwise. She had Agricola and her group had no interest in Caverna. Her loss, my gain.\n\n\\- I got TtR USA for $10 via Craiglist. Again, it looked like the game was only played 2-3 times. The box had a minor damage (a small punchthrough hole in the bottom). Patched it up without any issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI frequent r/Boardgamedeals and BGG 'Hot Deals' forum almost on a daily basis to see if there are any sales on the games that I've been interested in buying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Most expensive games:**\n\nLike I mentioned before, I bought most of my games when they were on sale. Scythe ($40 at Amazon US w/ holiday promo for using an Amex card) and Concordia Venus standalone ($43 at Amazon UK) are the most expensive games in my collection\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading and looking.

I also played some Risk and Axis &amp;amp; Allies in late 90s. I was introduced to Catan in early 00s and was mesmerized with it and played a few times with a bunch of my poker gaming buddies and I promptly forgot about it after I moved out of the area. I bought Catan 3 years ago and played it only 3-4 times with my wife due to lack of time and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been collecting seriously only since Thanksgiving of 2018. There was a bunch of sale on boardgame apps on Android during mid last year. Bought and played a few such as TtR, Pandemic, Carcassone, etc. on my phone and was like &amp;quot;I think my wife will enjoy playing more board games other than Catan&amp;quot; and bought some gateway games during the holiday season sales last year. Of course, my wife ended up liking the games and I started buying a whole bunch of new games these past few months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would you change about your collection if you could?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would like to own some medium-heavy/heavy weight games to my list but the problem is getting it to the table. We have 2 kids and we only get to play after we put them to bed either 2 player( or 4 player games with our neighbors who also have 2 young kids). They all want to play medium weight games so that we can play lot more games that way.
