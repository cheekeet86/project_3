I'm Eric J. Francis, the journalist who wrote [the Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-19/this-board-gaming-craze-comes-with-2-700-tables) (soft paywall). I  am only rarely on Reddit and didn't realize there had been a discussion  about it on here until I heard it mentioned on the So Very Wrong About  Games podcast. Here's more or less what I shared with them in response  to their comments and criticisms on the piece, many of which were also  raised here.\n\nLet  me start by noting that the contract I signed with Bloomberg prohibits  me from sharing any communications between myself and my editor  regarding what changes were made and why, though I\u2019ll go into as much  detail as I can in this post. It also prohibits me from sharing, for a  certain period after publication, the original draft, which was  substantially different from the published story \u2013 though, again, I\u2019ll  go into as much detail as I can on that.\n\nThat stipulated, here's what I have to say. This will not be brief, but it will be thorough.\n\nMy  bona fides: On the gaming side, I'm a lifelong nerd, learned D&amp;D in  1979, and was introduced to my first hobby board game, Cosmic  Encounter, in '91. I became a serous board game nerd in the past five or  so years. On the journalism side, I got my first reporting job in 1991  and have been employed full-time or freelance in the field since then.  I\u2019ve been a reporter, editor, and managing editor.\n\nThe  genesis of the Bloomberg story is this: I had freelanced for them back  in 2012, and earlier this year an editor I'd worked with sent out a  request for pitches. I already had the idea of writing about luxury  board gaming accessories, so I sent that in to him and he accepted. The  assignment was for 1,000 words.\n\nOver  the course of the next few weeks I interviewed several serious board  gamers (I didn\u2019t single out \u201crich people,\u201d as suggested, but  crowdsourced folks through BGG and my local FLGS game night), several  manufacturers of accessories, and researched hobby board gaming trends  and statistics. My initial submission was about 1,300 words. Over the  course of the next couple of weeks, my editor got back to me with  multiple requests for additional information and interviews, and the  final draft I submitted was some 3,000 words long.\n\nWhat  I can tell you about that draft: It included more from my interview  with Chris Stagno, more background info about the growth of the hobby,  more from each interview with the business owners, and -- crucially --  the overall draft told a cohesive story.\n\nA  lot of that didn't make it into the final cut, obviously. Why? Two  reasons. The first is that while there is technically no limit to space  on the internet, online news organizations that pay by the word do not  subscribe to this philosophy. And secondly, while I was writing from the  perspective of a gamer, the ultimate audience my editor was responsible  for is not gamers but businesspeople and folks with money, and he had  to make sure the article addressed them. (Props to Brodogmillionaire1  for hitting that nail on the head in his comment!)\n\nThe  cold fact is, this article wasn't for board gamers and the editor did  not tailor it to them as an audience. That\u2019s the reason behind many of  the editing choices.\n\nTake the headline.  Firstly, reporters do not generally get to write them. I suggested a  different one: \"Introducing the $4,500 board game night.\" This fit the  narrative I had created, which talked about how it was possible (not  required, but possible) for avid gamers with enough income to spend a  whole lot of money to pimp their game night. When the editor responded  with the one you saw, I went to bat for my original headline. I didn't  get my way.\n\nAnd then there's the \"if  you want to play and play it right\" line. Oy, vey! Trust me, that one  grates on me every bit as much as it does on you. My first draft said  something along the lines of \"But if you want to play it like a  hard-core board game hobbyist...,\" with a clear reference to ones with  disposable incomes; by the final draft, that was gone completely. When  the edit came back with the \"and play it right\" line, I suggested  switching to my first-draft phrasing \u2013 I even said to him something  like, \"You can play it right if you're sitting in the dirt\" -- but again  he was editing to suit his audience, and that's clearly an audience  that thinks \"doing it right\" means doing it in a way that flaunts your  cash flow.\n\nMy editor wasn't a board  gamer but he is an old D&amp;Der, which at least meant he was familiar  with the history of nerd gaming culture. But he also leaned a little  heavier on the D&amp;D angle than I would have liked -- the references  to playing in basements, pegging D&amp;D as the progenitor of modern  board games (the original draft talked about Catan's arrival in the U.S.  sparking the hobby here), etc. He felt that D&amp;D was well-known  enough among his audience to provide a touchstone for readers. I  disagreed with the way he implemented it but, again, reporters  (especially freelancers) generally don't have that much sway over final  content.\n\nReducing the draft from 3,000  to 1,600 published words also meant that all of the interviews were cut  pretty deeply. Again, I'm a narrative journalist, so every interview  section was a self-contained arc. The editor cut out all but what he  felt was the most relevant parts. In my comments I tried plugging some  stuff back in but, again, there he had a word count target. I'm  impressed he went as long as he did in the final version, given the  assignment was for 1,000 words.\n\nI'll  close by reinforcing the fact that I would love -- LOVE -- to combine my  nerd and professional lives and become a go-to professional board games  journalist for mainstream outlets. But the caveat for board gamers will  always be that those outlets (especially niche outlets like Bloomberg)  are NOT aimed at board gamers as a core audience, and most likely what  gets published will not fully satisfy hobbyists. Believe me, if there  was a Nerd Monthly magazine out there paying professional rates for  articles that delved deeply into the hobby and issues surrounding it,  I'd be doing my damndest to write for every single issue. But there  isn't. The hobby-related publications out there either pay nothing or a  trifle -- and part of the reason is, to be frank, there's no demand.  Effectively no one in the hobby is clamoring to pay for professional  journalism content about board gaming, since there is a lot of semi-pro  and amateur content available for free.\n\nI  hope this added perspective on the process my story went through  between the final draft and the published article is useful to y\u2019all. I  knew when it came out that many of the edits wouldn\u2019t sit well with a  lot of gamers. My hope is, though, that by getting an article about the  hobby into Bloomberg, it\u2019s going to create more opportunities for  professional journalist/gamers like myself to do more reporting about it  and reach broader audiences, and ultimately grow the hobby as a result.\n\nI\u2019ll do my best to check in on [r/boardgames](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/)  every now and then so I can keep up with the community here, and answer  questions about this article (and, hopefully, others in the future).  I\u2019m more often on Twitter (@CalligraphyGame, @EJFtweets) if you want to  contact me there. Thanks for taking the time to read this!\n\nSincerely,\n\nEric J.
