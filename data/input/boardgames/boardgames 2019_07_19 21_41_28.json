Given the hullabaloo about the SUSD review earlier this year, I figured I'd pitch in with my take on the game.\nA bit of background: My friends and I have played social deduction games, but it is definitely not our favorite genre by any means. We used to play The Resistance and One Night Ultimate Werewolf somewhat regularly, but those games fell out of fashion. In particular, we soured on The Resistance because there simply wasn\u2019t enough actual information in the game to make it \u2018interesting\u2019. We now mostly play medium-ish games, some favorites being Ginkopolis, Inis, Not Alone, Scythe, Terraforming Mars, and Spirit Island. I mostly wanted to try BOTC due to the SUSD review \u2013 the idea of having that wonderful big group experience while still having logical, tactical deduction instead of shouting matches sounded wonderful.\n\n\nMost people had played Mafia or Werewolf before, so explaining the rules was fairly simple. On the first game, the good characters cautiously shared information, while the evil players generally kept quiet and offered tentative alibis. It was only when the supposed monk realized that they were drunk did everyone go \u2018wait, what?\u2019 and the game started to shine. From there, the lies and deceptions started to flow much more naturally. We played another game right after with me storytelling, and another game with a new storyteller right after that. The new storyteller was able to pick up the role without too much effort, and we had a brilliant game of second guessing ourselves with a baron in play.\n\n\nAfter the initial 3 plays, we then played the game 5 times with almost the same group the next day. Everyone got much more comfortable with the different roles and at bluffing, although one person did get slightly flustered at being the imp three times in a row. But it was the last game that truly sold it for our group. The demon was about to be killed through a smart deception from the ravenkeeper, but the spy successfully planted the idea that a poisoner could be about. Her words caused the good team to frantically analyze any possibility of their previous assumptions being wrong. We wavered over which outsider was in play for 10 minutes. The supposed recluse almost burst a blood vessel after we spent so much time considering if there was a drunk. It finally ended when we finally decided on killing the demon, the good team collapsing in a group hug when the storyteller announced that good had triumphed. We spent the next 30 minutes exhilarated and exhausted, going over all the craziness that had happened. It was the kind of high that any player of a social deduction game dreams of.\n\n\nIt\u2019s a bit hard to explain what feels different between BOTC and its older cousins, but I think the biggest change is the lack of player elimination. Everyone can be involved for the whole game, and everyone *wants* to be involved for the whole game because they have their own unique role. This also means that the whole group is wrapped up in the dramatic tension at the end of the game \u2013 no one except the storyteller knows exactly what is going on. The game length varied a bit, but in general they were about 30 minutes all included with 7 players. The quick game length was definitely a plus overall, since most people got to experience different parts of the game with their different roles.\n\n\nOverall, this is definitely my #1 social deduction game now. I loved the way I was not only always questioning other players, but also myself. Whenever I had a hunch about another player lying, I could reason out how that hunch could affect the given scenario. Victories and losses both felt very earned. I can\u2019t wait to make printouts of the \u2018Bad Moon Rising\u2019 and \u2018Violets and Sects\u2019 modules, and I highly recommend anyone on the fence to print out a copy, grab a group, and try it for yourself.

Everyone got much more comfortable with the different roles and at bluffing, although one person did get slightly flustered at being the imp three times in a row. But it was the last game that truly sold it for our group. The demon was about to be killed through a smart deception from the ravenkeeper, but the spy successfully planted the idea that a poisoner could be about. Her words caused the good team to frantically analyze any possibility of their previous assumptions being wrong. We wavered over which outsider was in play for 10 minutes. The supposed recluse almost burst a blood vessel after we spent so much time considering if there was a drunk. It finally ended when we finally decided on killing the demon, the good team collapsing in a group hug when the storyteller announced that good had triumphed. We spent the next 30 minutes exhilarated and exhausted, going over all the craziness that had happened. It was the kind of high that any player of a social deduction game dreams of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a bit hard to explain what feels different between BOTC and its older cousins, but I think the biggest change is the lack of player elimination. Everyone can be involved for the whole game, and everyone &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to be involved for the whole game because they have their own unique role. This also means that the whole group is wrapped up in the dramatic tension at the end of the game \u2013 no one except the storyteller knows exactly what is going on. The game length varied a bit, but in general they were about 30 minutes all included with 7 players. The quick game length was definitely a plus overall, since most people got to experience different parts of the game with their different roles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, this is definitely my #1 social deduction game now. I loved the way I was not only always questioning other players, but also myself. Whenever I had a hunch about another player lying, I could reason out how that hunch could affect the given scenario. Victories and losses both felt very earned. I can\u2019t wait to make printouts of the \u2018Bad Moon Rising\u2019 and \u2018Violets and Sects\u2019 modules, and I highly recommend anyone on the fence to print out a copy, grab a group, and try it for yourself. I\u2019ll end by saying that I have never backed a kickstarter game before \u2013 and I hope to never do so again \u2013 but this is one game I really want to share with everyone I know and play it more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [{"is_enabled": true, "count": 1, "subreddit_id": null, "description": "Silver Award", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_width": 512, "icon_url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png", "days_of_premium": 0, "icon_height": 512, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "days_of_drip_extension": 0, "award_type": "global", "coin_price": 100, "id": "gid_1", "name": "Silver"}], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "capmnx", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "StadstheEidolon", "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 52, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/boardgames/comments/capmnx/blood_on_the_clocktower_review/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/capmnx/blood_on_the_clocktower_review/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2056539, "created_utc": 1562613897.0, "discussion_type": null, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "boardgames", "selftext": "In a Chinese entertainment show called Keep Running, there was a variant mafia game with 10 people, where the mafia had to rip off a name-tag off the town people's backs in order to kill them.
