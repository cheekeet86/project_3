Just wanted to share my somewhat new found love for board games.\n\nMy wife and I were getting bored of video games and most of the time we played our own games separately so drifted apart a bit. Star Wars rebellion came out and I was soooo excited: I used to play the video game it I was based off of, not many people played it so it was awesome it kinda came back. \n\nMy wife was skeptical but she's a star wars fan also so we went for it. We ended up loving it despite it being a somewhat complex game for us at the time. After awhile we stopped playing because we didn't like playing against each other.\n\n Coop games right. I wanted a DnD like adventure game with single player for myself and went for Runebound third edition (liked the no dice, token idea) Ended up not being balanced well. The token system ended up being a little disappointing. So that was a bust, also didn't get into the theme. \n\nThen came pandemic which was a savior. My wife is a nurse so she delved into the theme. It's a true coop game where runebound you basically just traded cards. It's just an awesome simple enough game. We play 2 player but I want to try 2 player with 4 characters. I just bucked up and got the 10th anniversary edition in the metal case. Totally worth it.\n\nStar Wars Outer Rim! We literally (seriously) played it every night since I got it. This is what sold us on board games (with pandemics help) The theme is obvious, adventure awesome, solid balance. I've heard there are similar games that are supposedly better, but star wars. The solo ai is kinda clunky. We're thinking of adding an ai player as a third to mix it up. We've also mixed up the board.\n\nNext game we want is Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle Earth. It's everything we want in a game: single player, coop, adventure, theme (wife had a lotr themed sixteen bday cake...). We love getting in character, upgrading, leveling up, combat but also using skills for adventure stuff. Outer rim is really cool like that. Buy a ship, get some mods, gear, crew. Being han and getting the falcon is awesome but also switching it up like han teaming up with greedo in slave 1.\n\nEverybody gets on ff for putting out unfinished games and selling expansions. I don't feel that way with rebellion or outer rim. Still haven't got rebellions expansion, probably will cause rogue one is my favorite star wars movie (after empire)\n\nSo now we are addicted to board games. My hope is that we start getting better with learning rules and going for really complex games. Also trying to get some friends into it. Looking forward to lotr: journeys for now.\n\nTldr: wife and I got sick of video games. Get star wars rebellion cause I used to play the video game. Loved it. Wanted single player and coop, tried Runebound 3rd edition, disappointed. Pandemic 10th anniversary edition is awesome and saved the day.  Then Outer rim which is awesome also, we love star wars btw. Next is Lord of the Rings journey in middle Earth. Which has everything we want.

I definitely recommend it as a game to get non-gamers to the table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: formatting&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "b9a7eeba-5a70-11e7-baa7-0eeaeadb24f4", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": "Agricola", "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "cc1uxc", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "wishiwereskywalker", "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 28, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/boardgames/comments/cc1uxc/i_played_ethnos_for_the_first_time/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/cc1uxc/i_played_ethnos_for_the_first_time/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2056538, "created_utc": 1562881725.0, "discussion_type": null, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "boardgames", "selftext": "", "author_fullname": "t2_k0i1j", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "GameNight! - Wingspan", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_cbxw2r", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 40, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 40, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "default", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": false, "mod_note": null, "created": 1562892202.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "youtu.be", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": null, "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "cbxw2r", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mrepiq", "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 44, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/boardgames/comments/cbxw2r/gamenight_wingspan/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://youtu.be/WzyuRWpAT9g", "subreddit_subscribers": 2056538, "created_utc": 1562863402.0, "discussion_type": null, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "boardgames", "selftext": "Okay, I admit I'm not the best gamer ever, but I can't believe I'm also the worst.

The game is freaking great. And here's my review to explain why:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright Class. Take a seat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday we\u2019re learning about Agent: The Consortium.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt  starts with the Chancellor Nostros Calahaan\u2019s resignation and a vacant  job position which pays a cushy salary and allows you to wear your Harry  Potter cosplay without judgement. So of course, you need to apply.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Name:** Argent the Consortium\n\n**Players:** 2-5\n\n**Publishers:** LVL99 Games\n\n**Year Published:** 2015\n\n**Designer:** Trey Chambers\n\n**Artists**: Jennifer Easley, Eunice Abigael Tiu\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut it\u2019s won't be easy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA panel of twelve secret judges selects who\u2019s going to sit in the chair, and it\u2019s up to you to win their favour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut who are they? And what do they want?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWelcome  to Argent the Consortium. Victory lies in you winning over the majority  of the panel, but each judge wants something different from their  candidate. From the richest, to most mana hungry, to most influential,  to the candidate with the most support. These judges start the game face  down. And reveal themselves to you only if they have your mark.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n([The components](https://rolltoreview.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/argent-the-consortium-lvl-99-games-review-components-2.jpg?w=794&amp;h=719))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou  start the game with one mark already on the board, but throughout the  game you get chances to place more. Until you place all twelve, you  never know where you stand and how close you are to the chancellery.  This creates a level of uncertainty between you and the other  applicants. As everyone starts the game with a different piece of  information, you need to try and guess what they saw, or spend a turn to  place a mark and confirm it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis  doubt makes you feel like you\u2019re all stumbling in a dark room together.  However, the game never gets that aimless. As you\u2019re constantly growing  more and more powerful, regardless of if you\u2019re closer to winning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis  feeling of doubt grows when you do draw a mark. As you\u2019ll immediately  check the table for who\u2019s winning it. And usually, it\u2019s not you. This is  when human nature kicks you crotch, as even though you might be winning  several other marks \u2013 it\u2019s the one you\u2019re not winning that you\u2019ll  concentrate on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause  of this you have this constant feeling of pressure and tension \u2013 you\u2019re  never satisfied with what you have. But when you go after another  judge\u2019s condition, it leaves the one\u2019s you\u2019ve previously been focusing  on open for competition. At that point you become a plate spinner,  trying to spin as many judges\u2019 conditions as you can, while hoping no  one knocks you over at the same time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s a great change from boring old victory points.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n([The game after setup](https://rolltoreview.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/argent-the-consortium-lvl-99-games-review-table-hog.jpg?w=966&amp;h=725))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut let\u2019s go back to the start.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou  begin with a waiting room of students looking for extra credit. On  every turn you can deploy one of these students to a building on campus,  this will net you rewards in the back-half of the round.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight  now though, you need to figure out where to place who. As each student  is learned in a type of magic, and when placed they put their talents to  work. For instance, the red students wound mages already in the room \u2013  sending them to the infirmary, meanwhile grey mages can be placed as an  extra action when you spend your turn casting a spell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis  removes the delay between placement and feedback you often find in  worker placement games. Allowing the decision of placement to go beyond  the basic should I go here now, or later. Instead focusing on how best  to allocate your resources. Should you use your red dudes to take out an  opposition early? Or your green guys\u2013 immune to wounding \u2013 to take up  defensive positions? But if doing that means you won\u2019t be able to cast  spells and place grey students?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s  this mechanic that should make you sit up straight in your chair right  now. The way Argent the Consortium blends its tactical and strategic  thinking together is what elevates the board game into a class of its  own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n([The minis](https://rolltoreview.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/argent-the-consortium-lvl-99-games-review-students.jpg?w=966&amp;h=725))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the times you don\u2019t want to place a worker down. You can instead use an item, supporter action, or a spell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese  spells come from the different schools of magic. As such they are all  unique, and all insanely powerful. With some spells allowing you to take  multiple turns, others can send everyone in a packed room to the  infirmary. Each spell can also be leveled up twice more, growing  exponentially more powerful. Giving you the same feeling as a level 1,  level 50, level 100 character from a mobile game advert.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile  each game you\u2019re guaranteed to get a spell, they cost a lot to cast,  and even more to level up. However, when you do, you\u2019ll be able to  control the board in ways that would feel broken in other games but  feels right at home here. Making for some crazy turns that stick in your  memory a long time after the game is done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe  last action you can perform is taking a bell tower card. These cards  give you a bonus for the round. When you pick up the last bell tower  card, the round is over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou  and the other candidates can use this mechanic to play with the pace of  the round as though it were the last pea on your plate. Sometimes  you\u2019ll have a slow war of attrition, whereby you\u2019ll try and use each  worker as efficiently as possible. Other times, you\u2019ll use speedy mages  to flood the board as quick as you can. It's yet another mechanism that  builds strategy and tactics into the game. With very little overhead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce  the last bell tower has been picked up, each room, and each worker in  the room is activated in turn. And you gain the bonus of the space that  they\u2019re on. It\u2019s now that you cross your fingers and toes and hope that  all your tactical warfare has led to a strategic advantage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter  five rounds, the game stops, and you reveal each judge in a dramatic  fashion worthy of reality TV. Once all are revealed, you have your  winner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n([A character card](https://rolltoreview.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/img_20190604_213240.jpg?w=966&amp;h=725))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile this sounds and looks like a heavy game, it never feels like a heavy game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSimilarly,  to Spirit Island and Great Western Trail the complexity comes from the  decision space, not learning and internalising rules. Also like those  games it begins by constricting your moves, giving you time to  familiarise yourself with the rules before throwing you in the deep end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe  beauty is even when you\u2019re in that deep end and find out you can\u2019t  swim, you can still flounder. And what I mean is that there are no bad  moves - just less efficient ones. Everything you do makes you more  powerful and feels meaningful. Even if no judge will praise you for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo  if you're looking for depth, Argent has plenty. And that\u2019s before you  consider everything in the box. Every building tile is double sided with  different worker placement spots on either side. Likewise, the playable  characters. On top of that, there are more spells, items, and  supporters than you would ever need.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is such an abundance of playable material, that you may never need another board game again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich is a huge compliment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut  let me do one better. This game is special. It gets me excited just  thinking about getting it to the table again. So much so, that in  writing this review I got so excited that I bought the expansion. That\u2019s  never happened before. Argent the Consortium is absolutely in the top 4  games I\u2019ve ever played.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n([And here's my dog](https://rolltoreview.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/argent-the-consortium-lvl-99-games-review-corgi.jpg?w=966&amp;h=725))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Thanks for reading.

And what do they want?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Welcome  to Argent the Consortium. Victory lies in you winning over the majority  of the panel, but each judge wants something different from their  candidate. From the richest, to most mana hungry, to most influential,  to the candidate with the most support. These judges start the game face  down. And reveal themselves to you only if they have your mark.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://rolltoreview.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/argent-the-consortium-lvl-99-games-review-components-2.jpg?w=794&amp;amp;h=719\"&gt;The components&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You  start the game with one mark already on the board, but throughout the  game you get chances to place more. Until you place all twelve, you  never know where you stand and how close you are to the chancellery.  This creates a level of uncertainty between you and the other  applicants. As everyone starts the game with a different piece of  information, you need to try and guess what they saw, or spend a turn to  place a mark and confirm it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This  doubt makes you feel like you\u2019re all stumbling in a dark room together.  However, the game never gets that aimless. As you\u2019re constantly growing  more and more powerful, regardless of if you\u2019re closer to winning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This  feeling of doubt grows when you do draw a mark. As you\u2019ll immediately  check the table for who\u2019s winning it. And usually, it\u2019s not you. This is  when human nature kicks you crotch, as even though you might be winning  several other marks \u2013 it\u2019s the one you\u2019re not winning that you\u2019ll  concentrate on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because  of this you have this constant feeling of pressure and tension \u2013 you\u2019re  never satisfied with what you have. But when you go after another  judge\u2019s condition, it leaves the one\u2019s you\u2019ve previously been focusing  on open for competition. At that point you become a plate spinner,  trying to spin as many judges\u2019 conditions as you can, while hoping no  one knocks you over at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a great change from boring old victory points.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=\"https://rolltoreview.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/argent-the-consortium-lvl-99-games-review-table-hog.jpg?w=966&amp;amp;h=725\"&gt;The game after setup&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But let\u2019s go back to the start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You  begin with a waiting room of students looking for extra credit. On  every turn you can deploy one of these students to a building on campus,  this will net you rewards in the back-half of the round.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right  now though, you need to figure out where to place who.

The game theme is a bit more sinister though. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my question is, when you guys first played did you think of a show, movie, or anything that the game reminded you of? Did that contribute to your enjoyment of the game?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "ce696ba0-b792-11e8-9508-0ed1a4fbdca2", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "id": "cc04a6", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RTPandar", "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 17, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/boardgames/comments/cc04a6/do_you_guys_relate_house_on_betrayal_hill_the/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/cc04a6/do_you_guys_relate_house_on_betrayal_hill_the/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2056538, "created_utc": 1562873527.0, "discussion_type": null, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "boardgames", "selftext": "Oh boy.
