{"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "boardgames", "selftext": "*Sorry about the long post. It had to be.*\n\nI have been blown away by Pax Pamir (second edition). I have played probably over 300 games which include some really heavy Euros, war games, American games right up to party games and roll and writes. I mean I'm very familiar with board game systems and mechanics and I generally know what to expect in a certain type of board game. Despite this, Pax Pamir (second edition) blew me away.\n\nI had not played any of the pax games before. This was my first. The playthrough video by Heavy Cardboard piqued my interest for the game (which is exactly why they make these videos I suppose). I normally to skip through and watch only parts of play through videos to see the board art, player boards and a couple of turns. Cole Wehrle, the designer, who was also on the playthrough seemed like a good bloke with lot of humility and knowledge, explained the game in an interesting manner, which made me watch through the entire episode.\n\nIn the first two weeks itself, this had seen about 10 plays which is the highest in our group(family) for any game, let alone a game of this depth. Here's my quick summary of the game:\n\n**Story**: Players are local tribal leaders in Afghanistan who are vying for a position in this great war and political dance among the three big factions (British, Russians &amp;amp; Afghans) fighting for dominance. In the game you're trying to do either of these things: (a) make your allied faction dominant and ensure that you have the most influence with this faction (b) if you can't achieve in making your faction most dominant or unable to have most influence with them, you ensure that you are the most powerful local tribal leader with most of your folk out there in the action. This summary itself should tell you this is not your run-of-the-mill board game. \n\nSome positives:\n\n**Components**: This could be the first reason why anyone who's never player a Pax game may be interested in Pax Pamir (second edition). The game looks gorgeous with the beuaitful fabric map, resin pieces in pastel colours and the awesome best-in-business metal coins (if you got those). You can come for the looks, but you're going to certainly stay for the game. \n\n**Minimal set up**: This is an important consideration for us. We have sold some good games for set up being too long and complicated for what it actually offers. This game has minimal set up for the depth and experience it offers. Time to first turn (from deciding to play to the first turn of the game) is just probably 5 mins. The only set up action is setting up the 58 card deck (for a 3 player game) which is super simple. \n\n**Low fiddliness**: Normally it's the number of components and the need for bookkeeping that drive the fiddliness in a game. This game has fewer components and probably no book keeping per se. This means low fiddliness which in turn results in quality time spent on playing the game rather than 'managing the game'. \n\n**Simple gameplay**: Very easy to teach and very easy to learn. In every turn, you play two actions - which is a combination or repetition of (a) buy a card (b) play a card (c) take the action from an already played card. This is all you're ever going to do. But you will have choices, numerous choices. You can teach the game 10-15 mins and start playing and introduce new concepts as you go along. \n\n**Depth of decisions**: I believe the quality of a board game is directly proportional to the quality of the decisions in that board game. In Pax Pamir (second edition), the decisions are very interesting and excruciating. And every decision you take can have a lasting impact on the progress of the game.\n\n*Consideration #1*: Do I want to buy a card or play a card or use an action from a played card? \n\n*Consideration #2*: Which card to buy - which one do I want, which one do I want to deny for my opponents, which ones can I and my opponents afford, which card helps my present, which card may help my future. \n\n*Consideration #3*: With the tight tableau and hand limits, the one I buy and the one I play is really worth its place in the tableau or the hand. Which of the cards in my hand provide the best instant impact when I play them.\n\n*Consideration #4*: Should I forgo the buying or playing of a card (and let my opponents expand) and use an action from a played card. Some actions require certain conditions to be present and require some cost.\n\n*Consideration #5*: Am I with the right faction? Do they have the chance of achieving domination? Even if they do, can I be the one with most influence with this faction? Is someone else pushing another faction despite having low influence with them? Do I need to change loyalties? At which point do I change loyalty? Should I forgo current/upcoming scoring with a big play in the future scoring? How can I increase my presence and that of my faction? How can I reduce the presence of opponents and their factions?\n\nMost heavy games require fair amount of number crunching and that sometimes in itself is a major contributor to the crunchiness of the game. In this game, there's almost no math except the additions which won't even involve double digit numbers usually. The decisions in this game is brain burny in a totally new way. \n\nThe manner in which the decisions in this game are simple as well as carry the depth is really insane. This game is a great example that a heavy game need not be complex. It can be very simple and still be a heavy game requiring a lot of solid decision making. \n\n**Fantastic player interaction**: When the game creates a puzzle for you, it so happens that you can sit in your corner and solve it and check were you the first one to solve or were you the one to solve in the most efficient way. Most of the euros (that I like) are of this kind. But when the puzzle is created and shaped by your fellow players, you need to interact with them and outsmart them. The player interaction in this game is something that's very unique and very unlike anything I've seen in other games. It's so in-your-face but also it's not that mean. The whole game is about shifting loyalties, betraying and backstabbing so you almost come to expect a level of meanness. You may end up joining hands with the very player that backstabbed you last turn because it helps your cause to work with her now. It's interesting the game doesn't feel like a mean game despite all this fierce interaction. That in itself is a great accomplishment by the designer. \n\n**Tabletalk**: This is an important consideration in our games, especially the bigger games. I always assess a game based on how much and what kind of table talk the game creates. The table talk in this game is super interesting. Due to the fact that you're constantly trying to jockey for positions all through the game, it's impossible to play this game without any tabletalk. You have to 'help' the other player in making the right decision to ensure another player doesn't walk away with the game, only for her to clarify how if anything that would help me immensely in progressing my objectives if my advice is implemented. There are no permanent friends or permanent enemies in this game so this non-stop table talk totally brings the game alive. \n\n**Thrilling gameplay**: I love some drama in my games. The way the game unfolds each time we play is so unique and always tells a different story. Everytime we have played a game of Pax Pamir (second edition) we fondly recollect and summarize the story of the game that developed like a movie. With such variety of decisions available at your disposal, it's totally possible for a player to come up with a really creative solution to a problem that involves a sequence of actions, cajoling of opponents and some luck to pull a rabbit out of their hat. The game offers many many such moments of magic. Also, there's always some suspense in the air about what's going to happen next in the game. The more people play this game, the more unpredictable their play becomes. This is what makes the gameplay absolutely a thrilling experience. \n\n**Strategic as well as tactical**: Its not often games can combine strategy and tactics in equal measure. If the game is too tactical, you will go through the motions and open yourselves to the luck of the draw. If the game is too strategic, the game can be a bit of a drag with less interesting things to do on a turn by turn basis. If you hit the right balance, you have a winner. In this game, you're going to have three or four scoring opportunities in the game. Your position in relation to the board state at those junctures determine where you land on the scoring track. So you're always thinking of where you want to be when those scoring opportunities arise. But you need to keep an eye on the current pressures and quick wins too as they have a huge impact on the board state. \n\n**Replayability**: The game comes with about 120 cards of which only half of it may be used in a game. The cards that come out, the sequence in which it comes out, the faction arrangement among the players, timing of the scoring cards (called the dominance cards) all ensure that there's a unique experience everytime you play the game. This also means the replayability is incredible. The real proof is in wanting to play the game several times over a weekend and still not feeling samey about any of those games. Even the best of games (medium to heavy ones) need some time gap between plays to keep it fresh and interesting. The fact that you can play Pax Pamir back to back to back and still get a brand new experience is a testimony to its replayability. \n\n**Super-thematic**: You don't need highly evocative art and miniatures to tell a story. This game has theme dripping in every rule and action - the shifting of loyalty, prizes and gifts to win influence, tribes of the same faction not fighting on the map but using spies to fight out of the factions' sight, changing political climate, paying bribes and so on. After any game of Pax Pamir (second edition), you can narrate the game in such a way it may sound like a piece of history. There can be a cohesive story. Also, the card art is well done and the flavor text has lots of historical information of the period and the 'great game' of 19th century. \n\n**Wakhan!**: Wakhan is the solo mode AI character that is built not just to mess with your plans but also to go for the win by herself. To state a fact, in the games where we included Wakhan, she has a win rate of about 60-70%. This little deck of AI cards is a brilliant piece of work. It simplifies the AI turns and adds a lot of drama and gives a bloody good competitor for the human players to worry about and to target. Wakhan can be introduced not only on solo games but also as a third player with two human players. Funny times when the human players support the same faction and target Wakhan and her faction. To build a functional and competent AI in a game that involves backstabbing, betrayal, heavy player interaction etc sounds like a really challenging job and the team has pulled it off with flying colours. \n\n**Value for money**: The way I assess the value of a game, the quantity and quality of plays of this game mean the value has already exceeded the price I paid for this game and it will only increase with time. This game needs no expansion because it's complete as it is. You can buy this off the shelf and get a full value for money. I can be greedy and want more cards in future but it's not necessary at all. Same with the components. No need to bling the game as the retail game comes blinged. The only exception is the metal coins. It's not a must but it certainly adds certain something to the game. These are some of the best metal coins I've seen in a game with the right weight, size, colour and art. \n\nSome of the best games I like involve heavy set up, high fiddliness, crunchy calculations, minimal interactions, minimal table talk and steady, predictable game play and soem get played once in a year putting a question on the value for money. I never thought I'd find a deep and heavy game, that's got minimal set up, low fiddliness, minimal to no mathematics, excellent table talk, thrilling game play with a high value for money.\n\nIf I nit pick, I can find some negatives even with my most favourite games that I'd rate a 10 (like Twilight Struggle, Dominant Species, Le Havre, Wildcatters, Castell etc). I'd find it really hard to come up with any negatives for Pax Pamir (second edition). \n\nAnd even these favorites sometimes need me in a certain mood and mindset to play. As much as I adore Twilight Struggle, I'm not going to say yes everytime someone asks to play it. But I think I've found my 'always ready to play, all the time' kinda game in Pax Pamir (second edition). Of all adjectives and superlatives I've used in this piece, this is probably the highest praise I can give for this game. Plus, of course, if it's not clear yet, this has become my #1 game of all time moving ahead of all the other board game stalwarts. Yup, this #1868 ranked game in BGG list has become my most favourite game.", "author_fullname": "t2_14cw5j", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How Pax Pamir (second edition) stunned me with its brilliance . . .", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_cc5ib0", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 133, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 133, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1562907278.0, "author_flair_css_class": "hansa-teutonica", "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "After the game, the king and the pawn go into the same box . . ."}], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1562930588.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "domain": "self.boardgames", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sorry about the long post.

Cole Wehrle, the designer, who was also on the playthrough seemed like a good bloke with lot of humility and knowledge, explained the game in an interesting manner, which made me watch through the entire episode.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the first two weeks itself, this had seen about 10 plays which is the highest in our group(family) for any game, let alone a game of this depth. Here&amp;#39;s my quick summary of the game:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story&lt;/strong&gt;: Players are local tribal leaders in Afghanistan who are vying for a position in this great war and political dance among the three big factions (British, Russians &amp;amp; Afghans) fighting for dominance. In the game you&amp;#39;re trying to do either of these things: (a) make your allied faction dominant and ensure that you have the most influence with this faction (b) if you can&amp;#39;t achieve in making your faction most dominant or unable to have most influence with them, you ensure that you are the most powerful local tribal leader with most of your folk out there in the action. This summary itself should tell you this is not your run-of-the-mill board game. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some positives:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Components&lt;/strong&gt;: This could be the first reason why anyone who&amp;#39;s never player a Pax game may be interested in Pax Pamir (second edition). The game looks gorgeous with the beuaitful fabric map, resin pieces in pastel colours and the awesome best-in-business metal coins (if you got those). You can come for the looks, but you&amp;#39;re going to certainly stay for the game. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal set up&lt;/strong&gt;: This is an important consideration for us. We have sold some good games for set up being too long and complicated for what it actually offers. This game has minimal set up for the depth and experience it offers. Time to first turn (from deciding to play to the first turn of the game) is just probably 5 mins. The only set up action is setting up the 58 card deck (for a 3 player game) which is super simple. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low fiddliness&lt;/strong&gt;: Normally it&amp;#39;s the number of components and the need for bookkeeping that drive the fiddliness in a game. This game has fewer components and probably no book keeping per se. This means low fiddliness which in turn results in quality time spent on playing the game rather than &amp;#39;managing the game&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple gameplay&lt;/strong&gt;: Very easy to teach and very easy to learn. In every turn, you play two actions - which is a combination or repetition of (a) buy a card (b) play a card (c) take the action from an already played card. This is all you&amp;#39;re ever going to do. But you will have choices, numerous choices. You can teach the game 10-15 mins and start playing and introduce new concepts as you go along. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depth of decisions&lt;/strong&gt;: I believe the quality of a board game is directly proportional to the quality of the decisions in that board game. In Pax Pamir (second edition), the decisions are very interesting and excruciating. And every decision you take can have a lasting impact on the progress of the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consideration #1&lt;/em&gt;: Do I want to buy a card or play a card or use an action from a played card? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consideration #2&lt;/em&gt;: Which card to buy - which one do I want, which one do I want to deny for my opponents, which ones can I and my opponents afford, which card helps my present, which card may help my future. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consideration #3&lt;/em&gt;: With the tight tableau and hand limits, the one I buy and the one I play is really worth its place in the tableau or the hand. Which of the cards in my hand provide the best instant impact when I play them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consideration #4&lt;/em&gt;: Should I forgo the buying or playing of a card (and let my opponents expand) and use an action from a played card. Some actions require certain conditions to be present and require some cost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consideration #5&lt;/em&gt;: Am I with the right faction? Do they have the chance of achieving domination? Even if they do, can I be the one with most influence with this faction? Is someone else pushing another faction despite having low influence with them? Do I need to change loyalties? At which point do I change loyalty? Should I forgo current/upcoming scoring with a big play in the future scoring? How can I increase my presence and that of my faction? How can I reduce the presence of opponents and their factions?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most heavy games require fair amount of number crunching and that sometimes in itself is a major contributor to the crunchiness of the game. In this game, there&amp;#39;s almost no math except the additions which won&amp;#39;t even involve double digit numbers usually. The decisions in this game is brain burny in a totally new way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The manner in which the decisions in this game are simple as well as carry the depth is really insane. This game is a great example that a heavy game need not be complex. It can be very simple and still be a heavy game requiring a lot of solid decision making. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fantastic player interaction&lt;/strong&gt;: When the game creates a puzzle for you, it so happens that you can sit in your corner and solve it and check were you the first one to solve or were you the one to solve in the most efficient way. Most of the euros (that I like) are of this kind. But when the puzzle is created and shaped by your fellow players, you need to interact with them and outsmart them. The player interaction in this game is something that&amp;#39;s very unique and very unlike anything I&amp;#39;ve seen in other games. It&amp;#39;s so in-your-face but also it&amp;#39;s not that mean. The whole game is about shifting loyalties, betraying and backstabbing so you almost come to expect a level of meanness. You may end up joining hands with the very player that backstabbed you last turn because it helps your cause to work with her now. It&amp;#39;s interesting the game doesn&amp;#39;t feel like a mean game despite all this fierce interaction. That in itself is a great accomplishment by the designer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tabletalk&lt;/strong&gt;: This is an important consideration in our games, especially the bigger games. I always assess a game based on how much and what kind of table talk the game creates. The table talk in this game is super interesting. Due to the fact that you&amp;#39;re constantly trying to jockey for positions all through the game, it&amp;#39;s impossible to play this game without any tabletalk. You have to &amp;#39;help&amp;#39; the other player in making the right decision to ensure another player doesn&amp;#39;t walk away with the game, only for her to clarify how if anything that would help me immensely in progressing my objectives if my advice is implemented. There are no permanent friends or permanent enemies in this game so this non-stop table talk totally brings the game alive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thrilling gameplay&lt;/strong&gt;: I love some drama in my games. The way the game unfolds each time we play is so unique and always tells a different story. Everytime we have played a game of Pax Pamir (second edition) we fondly recollect and summarize the story of the game that developed like a movie. With such variety of decisions available at your disposal, it&amp;#39;s totally possible for a player to come up with a really creative solution to a problem that involves a sequence of actions, cajoling of opponents and some luck to pull a rabbit out of their hat. The game offers many many such moments of magic. Also, there&amp;#39;s always some suspense in the air about what&amp;#39;s going to happen next in the game. The more people play this game, the more unpredictable their play becomes. This is what makes the gameplay absolutely a thrilling experience. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic as well as tactical&lt;/strong&gt;: Its not often games can combine strategy and tactics in equal measure. If the game is too tactical, you will go through the motions and open yourselves to the luck of the draw. If the game is too strategic, the game can be a bit of a drag with less interesting things to do on a turn by turn basis. If you hit the right balance, you have a winner. In this game, you&amp;#39;re going to have three or four scoring opportunities in the game. Your position in relation to the board state at those junctures determine where you land on the scoring track. So you&amp;#39;re always thinking of where you want to be when those scoring opportunities arise. But you need to keep an eye on the current pressures and quick wins too as they have a huge impact on the board state. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replayability&lt;/strong&gt;: The game comes with about 120 cards of which only half of it may be used in a game. The cards that come out, the sequence in which it comes out, the faction arrangement among the players, timing of the scoring cards (called the dominance cards) all ensure that there&amp;#39;s a unique experience everytime you play the game. This also means the replayability is incredible. The real proof is in wanting to play the game several times over a weekend and still not feeling samey about any of those games. Even the best of games (medium to heavy ones) need some time gap between plays to keep it fresh and interesting. The fact that you can play Pax Pamir back to back to back and still get a brand new experience is a testimony to its replayability. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super-thematic&lt;/strong&gt;: You don&amp;#39;t need highly evocative art and miniatures to tell a story. This game has theme dripping in every rule and action - the shifting of loyalty, prizes and gifts to win influence, tribes of the same faction not fighting on the map but using spies to fight out of the factions&amp;#39; sight, changing political climate, paying bribes and so on. After any game of Pax Pamir (second edition), you can narrate the game in such a way it may sound like a piece of history. There can be a cohesive story. Also, the card art is well done and the flavor text has lots of historical information of the period and the &amp;#39;great game&amp;#39; of 19th century. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wakhan!&lt;/strong&gt;: Wakhan is the solo mode AI character that is built not just to mess with your plans but also to go for the win by herself. To state a fact, in the games where we included Wakhan, she has a win rate of about 60-70%. This little deck of AI cards is a brilliant piece of work. It simplifies the AI turns and adds a lot of drama and gives a bloody good competitor for the human players to worry about and to target. Wakhan can be introduced not only on solo games but also as a third player with two human players. Funny times when the human players support the same faction and target Wakhan and her faction. To build a functional and competent AI in a game that involves backstabbing, betrayal, heavy player interaction etc sounds like a really challenging job and the team has pulled it off with flying colours. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value for money&lt;/strong&gt;: The way I assess the value of a game, the quantity and quality of plays of this game mean the value has already exceeded the price I paid for this game and it will only increase with time. This game needs no expansion because it&amp;#39;s complete as it is. You can buy this off the shelf and get a full value for money. I can be greedy and want more cards in future but it&amp;#39;s not necessary at all. Same with the components. No need to bling the game as the retail game comes blinged. The only exception is the metal coins. It&amp;#39;s not a must but it certainly adds certain something to the game. These are some of the best metal coins I&amp;#39;ve seen in a game with the right weight, size, colour and art. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the best games I like involve heavy set up, high fiddliness, crunchy calculations, minimal interactions, minimal table talk and steady, predictable game play and soem get played once in a year putting a question on the value for money. I never thought I&amp;#39;d find a deep and heavy game, that&amp;#39;s got minimal set up, low fiddliness, minimal to no mathematics, excellent table talk, thrilling game play with a high value for money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I nit pick, I can find some negatives even with my most favourite games that I&amp;#39;d rate a 10 (like Twilight Struggle, Dominant Species, Le Havre, Wildcatters, Castell etc). I&amp;#39;d find it really hard to come up with any negatives for Pax Pamir (second edition). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And even these favorites sometimes need me in a certain mood and mindset to play. As much as I adore Twilight Struggle, I&amp;#39;m not going to say yes everytime someone asks to play it. But I think I&amp;#39;ve found my &amp;#39;always ready to play, all the time&amp;#39; kinda game in Pax Pamir (second edition). Of all adjectives and superlatives I&amp;#39;ve used in this piece, this is probably the highest praise I can give for this game. Plus, of course, if it&amp;#39;s not clear yet, this has become my #1 game of all time moving ahead of all the other board game stalwarts. Yup, this #1868 ranked game in BGG list has become my most favourite game.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": "After the game, the king and the pawn go into the same box . . .", "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "cc5ib0", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LittleBlueCubes", "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 117, "send_replies": false, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/boardgames/comments/cc5ib0/how_pax_pamir_second_edition_stunned_me_with_its/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/cc5ib0/how_pax_pamir_second_edition_stunned_me_with_its/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2056538, "created_utc": 1562901788.0, "discussion_type": null, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "boardgames", "selftext": "I recently got to play Spirit Island for the first time!

I think that Adversarial Spirits could have their own unique powers, sorted into different power levels (I am unsure if this should be random or a known progression). Each adversary would have their cards drawn in response to different player-actions: some might activate a card every time a city is destroy, or every time a fear card is drawn, etc. This might overwhelm the player, but it also might lead to interesting decisions. For example, destroying cities becomes something that might not always be beneficial since it could activate an adversarial card before the player is ready to deal with its effects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Edit:*** I seem to have been a little unclear about how the spirits would work. I do not think turning this wonderful co-op game into a competitive game would work well.

The idea is that the Adversarial Spirits would be automated somehow, though I'm not sure exactly how that would work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome ideas for adversarial spirits:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Heart of Heroes: The Heart of Heroes in humans or spirits overcoming overwhelming odds and triumphing in the face of adversary. Because of this it will actively make the spirits and Dahan's job dealing with the invaders harder. The Heart also finds the invaders intrepid nature and bravery (they are moving to a completely new land and dealing with terrifying supernatural creations after all) inspiring. It will sometimes challenge the invaders as well and make their job harder, as well as aid the Dahan and, potentially, the spirits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWisdom of the Cloudbreaker: A spirit who only desires to accumulate knowledge and information. Cloudbreaker actively aided the Dahan during the First and Second Reckoning by fighting against some of the sky-based Spirits, thus earning its name. The coming of the invaders has dramatically increased its access to human knowledge, and so it will fight to keep the newcomers from being forced off the island. Most of its cards focus on defending the invaders from the spirits powers, but many of its cards will protect the Dahan as well. Will sometimes target Spirits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey who Swear Vengeance: They who Swear Vengeance actively desires to destroy the Dahan. They who Swear's cards focus purely on eradicating the Dahan, whether that is by making them attack wild beasts, forcing them into the sea, causing the invaders to wage war upon them, or by simply destroying them with fire and fury.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHellbringer: Unsure about backstory. Wants to destroy the land itself. Focuses on creating uninhabitable zones and a lot of blight. Directly works against the Spirits and all humans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, I agree to the terms for creating Spirit Island game elements [set forth in the FAQ](https://querki.net/u/darker/spirit-island-faq/#!.9v5ka4u)", "author_fullname": "t2_cytkxtm", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Spirit Island: Adversarial Spirit Idea", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ccbtdr", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1562979851.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1562971815.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.boardgames", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;#39;ve been thinking of testing a concept I came up with, &amp;quot;Adversarial Spirits&amp;quot;.
