I've now played 10 of 12 sessions, and wanted to talk about why I think it is a super unique experience.\n\nOne fo the things I love about games is the excitement of a playing a new one. I think a lot of people share this: we play many games because we love the puzzle, and a new game is a new puzzle to solve. Charterstone, by unlocking new spots on the board locations, workers, and development cards, makes a new puzzle everytime you play. On top of this, the guideposts provide a new goal (and often a game altering, one-time special rule) which changes the puzzle regardless of the changes on the board. I know there are plenty of games that change the subset of cards we play with or the win conditions, offering \"infinite\" replayability. However, even though it is hard to explain why, Charterstone feels different. Maybe that's because Charterstone is always moving forward, subtracting and adding, insted of recombining the same mechanics. To put it abstractly, Charterstone's progress feels linear, while other games with a constantly-changing puzzle feel circular.\n\nI also know that other Legacy games might offer something similar, but it seems that Charterstone's focus on being a Euro-game first puts the puzzle at the forefront, while most other legacy games to-date are plot-driven. I really hope there are other eurolegacy games in development, even though ti seems like the legacy craze has died down a bit.\n\nThis game isn't perfect of course, and I think this is its biggest flaw: I think it would be pretty hard to find 6 people in the same group who all loved this game, and I also can't imagine playing it without 6 people (there are rules for automated players that just wouldn't be the same). In my family 2 people love it, 2 like it, and 2 can't wait for it to be over.\n\nThe other biggest flaw is that in terms of scoring points and winning, I think the scoring incentivizes you to find a simple boring engine and hold on to it for dear life, instead of welcoming the changes and trying new strategies. That's why my wife was really bored with the game, despite winning half of the rounds. \n\nI got charterstone for 29.99 around October last year.

Due to extenuating life circumstances, I wound up taking care of my Mom full-time as she had developed dementia.  During that time, I stumbled across Wil Wheaton's TableTop Youtube show, and acquiring board games turned into a reward mechanism for me to cope with the situation I was in.  So down the rabbit hole I went.  About all of my games have been opened, punched out, but never played, since I really couldn't go out and make friends and have them over. I finally got back on my feet in 2017 and I joined a board game group earlier this year, and am finally culling my collection, getting rid of all the wheat, so I'm left with all the chaff. (Points if you get that reference)\n\n*What would you change about your collection if you could?*\n\nOh man. So many things.  I wouldn't have gone nuts in the beginning, buying everything that looked appealing.  I'd also try to talk my former self off the ledge whenever I reasoned I could save $6 in shipping if I order another $50 worth of games.\n\n*What is your favorite type of game?*\n\nI love games that give me a story to tell afterwards.  Games like Burgle Bros., Robinson Crusoe, SW Outer Rim, Eldritch Horror, etc.\n\n*What latest games have you bought?*\n\nWingspan, SW Outer Rim, and I have Century: Golem edition in the mail.  \n  \n*Anything leaving your collection soon?*\n\nCastle Panic will be getting replaced by Carnival Zombie once the Kickstarter comes in; same with Suburbia, as I ordered the new KS edition.  I'm also getting rid of Qwirkle at some point.  \n  \nThanks for humoring me and looking at my stuff.  Hopefully I've inspired someone to take on DIY project of their own.  I love seeing what people come up with!

Due to extenuating life circumstances, I wound up taking care of my Mom full-time as she had developed dementia.  During that time, I stumbled across Wil Wheaton&amp;#39;s TableTop Youtube show, and acquiring board games turned into a reward mechanism for me to cope with the situation I was in.  So down the rabbit hole I went.  About all of my games have been opened, punched out, but never played, since I really couldn&amp;#39;t go out and make friends and have them over. I finally got back on my feet in 2017 and I joined a board game group earlier this year, and am finally culling my collection, getting rid of all the wheat, so I&amp;#39;m left with all the chaff. (Points if you get that reference)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What would you change about your collection if you could?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh man. So many things.  I wouldn&amp;#39;t have gone nuts in the beginning, buying everything that looked appealing.  I&amp;#39;d also try to talk my former self off the ledge whenever I reasoned I could save $6 in shipping if I order another $50 worth of games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is your favorite type of game?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love games that give me a story to tell afterwards.  Games like Burgle Bros., Robinson Crusoe, SW Outer Rim, Eldritch Horror, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What latest games have you bought?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wingspan, SW Outer Rim, and I have Century: Golem edition in the mail.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anything leaving your collection soon?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Castle Panic will be getting replaced by Carnival Zombie once the Kickstarter comes in; same with Suburbia, as I ordered the new KS edition.  I&amp;#39;m also getting rid of Qwirkle at some point.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for humoring me and looking at my stuff.
