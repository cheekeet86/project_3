My wife always crushes. It\u2019s just shapes and colors? No. It\u2019s crap and garbage. Now, this game isn\u2019t low because I\u2019m bad. I swear. I\u2019m not THAT bitter. This game just doesn\u2019t do anything for me. Is anyone ever excited to play Qwirkle? This game is now blocks for my daughter to build towers with. Congrats Qwirkle, you\u2019ve staved off elimination with toddler immunity.\n\n \n\n89\\. **Meeple Circus** - 1 Play \u2013 I played this at Origins this year. I had this game built up so much in my group as this game we had to get. I just never wanted to spend $50 on it. I would try and make bets where the loser had to buy Meeple Circus. I just had to stack an elephant meeple on a tiger on a strong man. But man, it was underwhelming. I think if I was given this game, I\u2019d play it for stupid fun about once every 6 months, but this is definitely not worth spending money on.\n\n \n\n88\\. **Blokus** - 1 Play (recorded, but many more than that) \u2013 I\u2019ve said \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit about Blokus\u201d more than once to my friends. This game is fine, I\u2019m actually probably more willing to play it than other games above it. It\u2019s just not exciting. Blokus is green beans. There\u2019s nothing offensive about it, but I\u2019m never going choose put it on my plate. Please don\u2019t @ me about green beans.\n\n \n\n87\\. **Dominion: Intrigue** - 1 Play \u2013 This went over so well I don\u2019t even remember playing it. I\u2019ve played regular Dominion too (that\u2019s obviously higher up). I must\u2019ve just had a bad experience with these sets of cards. I dunno. Just play base Dominion\n\n \n\n86\\. **Covert** - 2 Plays \u2013 Both these plays were at 2 players. I wonder if this would be better at more players. My friend bought this game, we learned it on the spot and he\u2019s never brought it up again. He\u2019s left all of his games at my house\u2026except this one. Sometimes I wonder if this game is Covert is actually a spy and it\u2019s ran off to do its next spy thing, but more than likely it\u2019s in the trash can.\n\n \n\n85\\. **Smash Up** - 1 Play \u2013 I played this game on the tail end of a decathalon (10 games in a day) and it was the only game that divulged into a quasi-argument. Possibly because it had been 14 hours with the same people, but that just left a bad taste in my mouth. I don\u2019t get offended by being attacked in other games or take that, but something happened that game. I could see this game being fun. If I owned it, I bet it would rise up.\n\n \n\n84\\. **Five Tribes** - 8 Plays \u2013 I put this game in my 10x10 this year and due to this, Five Tribes has fallen about 50 spots. Players with AP kill this game\u2026absolutely kills it. This game should\u2019ve come with a sand timer. If you don\u2019t make a move in 30 seconds, you lose a billion coins. You may remember from the last 10 that VARIABILITY DOES NOT EQUAL REPLAYABILITY. This is the poster child. Set up is always different, different djinns, market row\u2026ton of variability. The optimal strategy stays the same though. Don\u2019t bid high, something will be there for you. Go for green and set collect as much as possible. As soon as I\u2019m finished with my 10x10, this game is going gone.\n\n \n\n83\\. **Risk** - 1 Play (recorded, but many more than that) \u2013 This is what I did in high school. My friends would come over every Saturday and we played Risk. I loved Risk so much. It felt like war. I don\u2019t get the whole \u201cI don\u2019t like game X because it didn\u2019t make me feel like a coal miner.\u201d It\u2019s a board game! You\u2019re pushing around cardboard and plastic! But Risk did make me feel like a war strategist. It just doesn\u2019t hold up now that I\u2019ve played other games. It\u2019s too long. It\u2019s too luck dependent. It\u2019s too king-making. And if anyone is going to be king-making, it\u2019s going to be me (my last name is King and I\u2019ve made 2 Kings).\n\n \n\n82\\. **Risk Legacy** - 8 Plays \u2013 It ends faster? This is hurt because I played Pandemic Legacy before this game, but man, there\u2019s not much to it. I expected story. I expected wholesale changes every game. This just doesn\u2019t deliver. Only 7 more plays to go\u2026oh my gosh\u20267 more plays.\n\n \n\n81\\. **12 Days** - 12 Plays (that\u2019s weird) \u2013 On the 5th day of Christmas my true love gave to me\u2026would you look at that? It\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s another 11. Who would have thought? This is the 5th 11 I\u2019ve been passed. I love Christmas. I\u2019m like a 10 year old at Christmas. I like getting gifts, I like giving gifts, I like the songs, and I like the movies. And I do like playing 12 Days around the holidays. But the game ain\u2019t great, folks. But its 15 minutes and it\u2019s got a fun theme and it\u2019s a little different than other stuff I\u2019ve played.

Players with AP kill this game\u2026absolutely kills it. This game should\u2019ve come with a sand timer. If you don\u2019t make a move in 30 seconds, you lose a billion coins. You may remember from the last 10 that VARIABILITY DOES NOT EQUAL REPLAYABILITY. This is the poster child. Set up is always different, different djinns, market row\u2026ton of variability. The optimal strategy stays the same though. Don\u2019t bid high, something will be there for you. Go for green and set collect as much as possible. As soon as I\u2019m finished with my 10x10, this game is going gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;83. &lt;strong&gt;Risk&lt;/strong&gt; - 1 Play (recorded, but many more than that) \u2013 This is what I did in high school. My friends would come over every Saturday and we played Risk. I loved Risk so much. It felt like war. I don\u2019t get the whole \u201cI don\u2019t like game X because it didn\u2019t make me feel like a coal miner.\u201d It\u2019s a board game! You\u2019re pushing around cardboard and plastic! But Risk did make me feel like a war strategist. It just doesn\u2019t hold up now that I\u2019ve played other games. It\u2019s too long. It\u2019s too luck dependent. It\u2019s too king-making. And if anyone is going to be king-making, it\u2019s going to be me (my last name is King and I\u2019ve made 2 Kings).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;82. &lt;strong&gt;Risk Legacy&lt;/strong&gt; - 8 Plays \u2013 It ends faster? This is hurt because I played Pandemic Legacy before this game, but man, there\u2019s not much to it. I expected story. I expected wholesale changes every game. This just doesn\u2019t deliver. Only 7 more plays to go\u2026oh my gosh\u20267 more plays.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;81. &lt;strong&gt;12 Days&lt;/strong&gt; - 12 Plays (that\u2019s weird) \u2013 On the 5th day of Christmas my true love gave to me\u2026would you look at that? It\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s another 11. Who would have thought? This is the 5th 11 I\u2019ve been passed. I love Christmas. I\u2019m like a 10 year old at Christmas. I like getting gifts, I like giving gifts, I like the songs, and I like the movies. And I do like playing 12 Days around the holidays. But the game ain\u2019t great, folks. But its 15 minutes and it\u2019s got a fun theme and it\u2019s a little different than other stuff I\u2019ve played. Five Tribes, you were beaten out by a card game that can be played 3 weeks out of the year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": "Scythe", "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "cetq3y", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cbjking", "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 48, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/boardgames/comments/cetq3y/the_top_100_that_no_one_asked_for_9081/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/cetq3y/the_top_100_that_no_one_asked_for_9081/", "subreddit_subscribers": 2056539, "created_utc": 1563462696.0, "discussion_type": null, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "boardgames", "selftext": "", "author_fullname": "t2_qakply6", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "We battle the nameless as we review Aeon\u2019s End War Eternal.

I already own Eldritch Horror and often play Mansions of Madness 2nd Edition so I was interested where this would fit in to the collection. However, after playing the first campaign through maybe 4 times I really cannot see where all the hype is coming from so I want to hear from others what it is that they like about the game. I will list some of the reasons why I like the other two much better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Set Up:** The LCG has a VERY large setup and pack away time in my opinion, and it at least feels that it takes as long as Eldritch to set up and certainly longer than Mansions.\n\n**Story:** I was fairly underwhelmed with the story side of the LCG. Much of the flavour text is repeated in one paragraph or two in 2 or 3 different locations. There is some branching of paths but it feels very minimal to me. In contrast, I think that the storytelling in Mansions is far superior and that the story really drives the game forward. Some of the newer scenarios in particular are amazing.\n\n**Character Development:** In the LCG character development is mostly done by modifying your deck. To me this feels underwhelming because one might add 2 or 3 cards over the course of a campaign and you may never in see them in your playthrough, as the decks are quite large. In contrast I find the character development in Eldritch very exciting because you find a lot of items that drastically change play, new spells, and improving skills has a huge impact.\n\n**Cost:** This is a big one, probably the biggest. A 4 player version of the LCG costs something like 70 euro (having to buy 2 copies of the game). This is more expensive than either Eldritch or Mansions and has SO many fewer pieces AND scenarios. This includes one campaign with three missions. The value from Eldritch or Mansions seems far superior to me.\n\n**Replayability:** I think that the LCG does have a good amount of replayability. You can play with different combinations of the 4 characters and try to figure out ways to win with those combinations. However, there is only one story in the box and the branching paths are very minimal. Mansions has I think 5 scenarios out of the box and new ones are much cheaper than the LCG expansions. Eldritch is not so story based so the comparison is not entirely fair but it does come with 4 elder gods and I think 12 characters so the replayability is much higher in my opinion. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, in conclusion I find that the LCG sits somewhere between Eldritch and Mansions. However, if you like the storytelling side then you are better off with mansions, if you prefer the character development side then go with Eldritch. Not to mention that both of these are, in my opinion, MUCH better value for money than the LCG. I am very interested to hear from others who have played other games in the universe and why they think that the LCG is the superior game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease, let us know if you have played Arkham Horror, Eldritch Horror or Mansions of Madness before in your post.", "author_fullname": "t2_3qx06b8f", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Arkham Horror LCG in comparison to Eldritch/Arkham/Mansions, your thoughts?", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ceryr0", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 23, "approved_by": null, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1563482426.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.boardgames", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy playing games in the Lovecraft universe and I also like to play 2 player games every now and then so I really had to buy the Arkham Horror LCG when I got the chance.
